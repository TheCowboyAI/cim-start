# Project Progress

## Current Status: Initial Design Phase

The CIM project is currently in the initial design phase. We have completed the high-level system architecture design, domain pattern definition, and determined the implementation architecture using NixOS with containers and NATS JetStream for event/object storage.

## Implementation Details

The system architecture is designed around seven core components:

1. **Information Unit System** - Standardized data containers with metadata
2. **Component Registry** - Component registration and discovery
3. **Pipeline Engine** - Workflow orchestration and data transformation
4. **Plugin System** - Extension mechanisms and capability negotiation
5. **Storage Manager** - Persistence and retrieval strategies
6. **User Interface Framework** - Visualization and interaction
7. **Integration Hub** - External system connectors

Components interact through message passing, interface contracts, and dependency injection. Data flows through the system via pipeline processing, transformation chains, and event streaming.

Additionally, nine domain pattern categories have been defined to guide information organization, processing, and presentation:

1. **Information Classification Patterns**
2. **Knowledge Representation Patterns**
3. **Information Retrieval Patterns**
4. **Content Processing Patterns**
5. **Information Synthesis Patterns**
6. **Collaborative Information Patterns**
7. **Information Lifecycle Patterns**
8. **Context Management Patterns**
9. **Adaptation Patterns**

The implementation architecture will use NixOS as a hyper-converged solution:
- Core system built as a NixOS configuration for the host
- Functionality added through modular NixOS modules
- Individual components deployed as isolated nixos-containers
- Minimal host focused on security, container hosting, and NATS messaging
- Part of a broader inventory management system

NATS JetStream will serve dual critical roles:
1. **Event Store** - For event sourcing, event streaming, and distributed event processing
2. **Object Store** - For persistent storage, binary object storage, and shared resource access

While the system is hyper-converged on a central server, it also communicates with remote cloud resources through NATS, creating a distributed architecture that extends beyond the local system.

We've implemented a robust multi-tier scaling architecture:
1. **"Leaf Node"** - Single hyper-converged node for local operations and connections
2. **3-Node Cluster** - Replica of the leaf node in clustered mode for high availability and compute-intensive tasks
3. **Wasabi** - Long-term archival storage for durability and disaster recovery

The scaling path follows: Leaf Node → 3-Node Cluster → Wasabi, allowing us to start with a single node deployment and scale up to a clustered environment when higher availability or processing capacity is required.

Our architecture focuses on medium-sized businesses in vertical markets, using a domain-driven design approach that:
1. **Uses Domains as Boundaries** - Creates clear separations between different domain concerns
2. **Balances Vertical Specialization and Common Functionality** - Supports both industry-specific domains and common business domains
3. **Enables Domain Composition** - Allows domains to be combined to meet specific business needs

This approach allows us to address specialized vertical market requirements while leveraging common business domains that all organizations need.

For domain object storage and visualization, we've adopted a phased approach:
1. **Initial Storage in Cypher Format** - Domain objects will be stored in `/domain` directory as Cypher graph format for easy import into Neo4j when ready
2. **Custom Visualization Tool** - A separate module using petgraph (Rust) and Iced UI framework will provide graph visualization capabilities
3. **NATS-Based Communication** - The domain graph visualization tool will communicate with core components via NATS, maintaining consistency with our overall architecture

This approach allows us to visualize and work with domain objects as a graph during development, while providing a clear path to Neo4j integration when the full system is deployed.

For backend service interfaces, we've established a dual-interface approach:
1. **NATS Subject-Based Messaging** - All backend services will be accessible via standardized NATS subjects, forming the primary interface for system components
2. **MCP Integration** - Services will provide AI interfaces through Mission Control Protocol (MCP), enabling structured interaction with AI components
3. **Vendor Integration Strategy** - We'll leverage vendor-provided MCP interfaces for third-party tools (like paperlessng) where available, while creating custom MCP servers for tools with specialized needs

This approach provides consistent access to backend resources while enabling AI-driven operations and integrating efficiently with third-party tools.

We've defined the core services that will constitute a base CIM installation:

1. **AI**: AI Chat Interface for system-wide interaction with multiple tuned models
2. **NATS**: Messaging backbone, event store, and object store
3. **Git**: Version control for configurations, source code, and issue tracking
4. **Mail**: Email system for communication and notifications
5. **Search**: Centralized search capabilities via SearXNG
6. **Docs**: Document management using PaperlessNG
7. **Web**: Web portal for unified system access
8. **WF**: Workflow automation via n8n
9. **Vault**: Secret management via Vaultwarden
10. **Notes**: Knowledge management with Obsidian or Trilium Next
11. **Feeds**: RSS feed integration for content processing
12. **DB**: Database services with Neo4j and PostgreSQL

Each service will be deployed as a containerized component, communicating via NATS and exposing MCP interfaces for AI interaction. Together, they form a complete information management ecosystem that can be composed to address specific vertical market needs.
