# Project Progress

## Current Status: Initial Design Phase

The CIM project is currently in the initial design phase. We have completed the high-level system architecture design and are now working on detailed component specifications and interface definitions.

## Completed Items

- [x] Initial project setup
- [x] Memory Bank system initialized
- [x] Basic documentation framework established
- [x] Project goals and context defined
- [x] High-level system architecture design
- [x] Core component identification
- [x] Component interaction model definition
- [x] Data flow pattern definition
- [x] Extension point identification

## In Progress

- [ ] Detailed component specifications
- [ ] Interface contract design
- [ ] API definition
- [ ] Extension mechanism details

## Upcoming Work

- [ ] Component specifications
- [ ] API design
- [ ] User interface concepts
- [ ] Proof-of-concept implementation

## Implementation Details

The system architecture is designed around seven core components:

1. **Information Unit System** - Standardized data containers with metadata
2. **Component Registry** - Component registration and discovery
3. **Pipeline Engine** - Workflow orchestration and data transformation
4. **Plugin System** - Extension mechanisms and capability negotiation
5. **Storage Manager** - Persistence and retrieval strategies
6. **User Interface Framework** - Visualization and interaction
7. **Integration Hub** - External system connectors

Components interact through message passing, interface contracts, and dependency injection. Data flows through the system via pipeline processing, transformation chains, and event streaming.

## Known Issues and Challenges

- Determining optimal component granularity
- Balancing flexibility with usability
- Defining clear component interfaces
- Ensuring performant composition mechanisms
- Designing for both ease of use and extensibility

## Learnings and Insights

- The modular component architecture provides a strong foundation for composability
- The pipeline processing model aligns well with information transformation needs
- A plugin system is essential for long-term extensibility
- Clear interface contracts will be critical for component interoperability
- Immutable information units with modification tracking support auditability
