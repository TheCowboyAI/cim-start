# Project Progress

## Current Status: Initial Design Phase

The CIM project is currently in the initial design phase. We have completed the high-level system architecture design, domain pattern definition, and determined the implementation architecture using NixOS with containers and NATS JetStream for event/object storage. We are now working on detailed component specifications and interface definitions.

## Implementation Details

The system architecture is designed around seven core components:

1. **Information Unit System** - Standardized data containers with metadata
2. **Component Registry** - Component registration and discovery
3. **Pipeline Engine** - Workflow orchestration and data transformation
4. **Plugin System** - Extension mechanisms and capability negotiation
5. **Storage Manager** - Persistence and retrieval strategies
6. **User Interface Framework** - Visualization and interaction
7. **Integration Hub** - External system connectors

Components interact through message passing, interface contracts, and dependency injection. Data flows through the system via pipeline processing, transformation chains, and event streaming.

Additionally, nine domain pattern categories have been defined to guide information organization, processing, and presentation:

1. **Information Classification Patterns**
2. **Knowledge Representation Patterns**
3. **Information Retrieval Patterns**
4. **Content Processing Patterns**
5. **Information Synthesis Patterns**
6. **Collaborative Information Patterns**
7. **Information Lifecycle Patterns**
8. **Context Management Patterns**
9. **Adaptation Patterns**

The implementation architecture will use NixOS as a hyper-converged solution:
- Core system built as a NixOS configuration for the host
- Functionality added through modular NixOS modules
- Individual components deployed as isolated nixos-containers
- Minimal host focused on security, container hosting, and NATS messaging
- Part of a broader inventory management system

NATS JetStream will serve dual critical roles:
1. **Event Store** - For event sourcing, event streaming, and distributed event processing
2. **Object Store** - For persistent storage, binary object storage, and shared resource access

While the system is hyper-converged on a central server, it also communicates with remote cloud resources through NATS, creating a distributed architecture that extends beyond the local system.

We've implemented a robust multi-tier scaling architecture:
1. **"Leaf Node"** - Single hyper-converged node for local operations and connections
2. **3-Node Cluster** - Replica of the leaf node in clustered mode for high availability and compute-intensive tasks
3. **Wasabi** - Long-term archival storage for durability and disaster recovery

The scaling path follows: Leaf Node → 3-Node Cluster → Wasabi, allowing us to start with a single node deployment and scale up to a clustered environment when higher availability or processing capacity is required.
