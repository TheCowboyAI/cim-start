# Project Progress

## Current Status: Initial Design Phase

The CIM project is currently in the initial design phase. We have completed the high-level system architecture design and domain pattern definition, and are now working on detailed component specifications and interface definitions.

## Completed Items

- [x] Initial project setup

## Implementation Details

The system architecture is designed around seven core components:

1. **Information Unit System** - Standardized data containers with metadata
2. **Component Registry** - Component registration and discovery
3. **Pipeline Engine** - Workflow orchestration and data transformation
4. **Plugin System** - Extension mechanisms and capability negotiation
5. **Storage Manager** - Persistence and retrieval strategies
6. **User Interface Framework** - Visualization and interaction
7. **Integration Hub** - External system connectors

Components interact through message passing, interface contracts, and dependency injection. Data flows through the system via pipeline processing, transformation chains, and event streaming.

Additionally, nine domain pattern categories have been defined to guide information organization, processing, and presentation:

1. **Information Classification Patterns**
2. **Knowledge Representation Patterns**
3. **Information Retrieval Patterns**
4. **Content Processing Patterns**
5. **Information Synthesis Patterns**
6. **Collaborative Information Patterns**
7. **Information Lifecycle Patterns**
8. **Context Management Patterns**
9. **Adaptation Patterns**

## Known Issues and Challenges

- Determining optimal component granularity
- Balancing flexibility with usability
- Defining clear component interfaces
- Ensuring performant composition mechanisms
- Designing for both ease of use and extensibility
- Ensuring coherent integration between technical architecture and domain patterns
- Maintaining consistency across pattern implementations

## Learnings and Insights

- The modular component architecture provides a strong foundation for composability
- The pipeline processing model aligns well with information transformation needs
- A plugin system is essential for long-term extensibility
- Clear interface contracts will be critical for component interoperability
- Immutable information units with modification tracking support auditability
- Domain patterns provide important context for technical implementation decisions
- Information classification and knowledge representation are foundational to the system design
