# Project Progress

## Current Status

The Initial System Design phase has been completed. We have established the architectural foundation for "A CIM" (Composable Information Machine) - a generic architectural pattern that can be instantiated for different domains. This architecture includes high-level system design, domain patterns, component specifications, interface definitions, and implementation approach. 

Rather than designing a single specific system, we've created a framework for building domain-specific CIM instances. We are now ready to move into the implementation phase, starting with common domain objects and core infrastructure components that can be extended for specific vertical markets.

All design decisions have been documented in the `/docs/notes/` directory, with each decision following a standardized format that includes context, implications, and relationships to other decisions.

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The CIM architecture pattern consists of seven core components:

1. **Information Unit System**: Standardized data containers with typed extensions, versioning, and transformation capabilities
2. **Component Registry**: Dynamic registration mechanism for service discovery with capability negotiation
3. **Pipeline Engine**: Orchestration of information flow with execution and resource management
4. **Storage Manager**: Multi-tiered storage abstraction with content-addressable storage using IPLD
5. **User Interface Framework**: Consistent UX across platforms with a shared technology stack
6. **Integration Hub**: External service connectivity with protocol support and transformation capabilities
7. **Plugin System**: Functionality covered by existing components and communication models

### Component Interfaces

All components communicate through standardized interfaces:

- **Event Interfaces**: For asynchronous, broadcast-style communication
- **Service Interfaces**: For request-response style direct operations
- **Command Interfaces**: For directive-based operations for component control

These interfaces follow consistent NATS subject naming conventions:
- Events: `cim.event.[component].[resource].[action]`
- Services: `cim.service.[component].[resource].[operation]`
- Commands: `cim.cmd.[component].[operation]`

All messages use a standardized envelope structure with metadata and payload sections.

### Implementation Approach

A CIM instance will be implemented as a NixOS-based hyper-converged solution:
- Core functionality as NixOS modules
- Components deployed as nixos-containers
- NATS JetStream for messaging, event sourcing, and object storage
- Minimal host focused on security and container management

### Data Storage

The architecture uses a multi-tier storage approach:
- IPLD for content-addressed, immutable object storage
- NATS JetStream as the primary event and object store
- Objects flow through: Leaf Node → 3-Node Cluster → Wasabi
- Event-object linkage creates an audit trail for all object operations

### Object Store

The Object Store uses InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD) as its foundational data model:
- Content-based addressing with CIDs (Content Identifiers)
- Immutability guarantees for stored data
- Merkle-DAG structure for complex object relationships
- DAG-CBOR format for efficient binary encoding

### Domain Approach

The architecture follows a domain-driven design approach:
- Clear domain boundaries separate business concerns
- Common domains (People, Organizations, Documents) provide foundation
- Vertical market domains enable industry-specific features
- Event-based communication maintains domain isolation
- Graph-based storage represents domain objects and relationships

### User Interfaces

Three primary user interfaces provide access to the system:
1. **Native Interface**: Rust application using the Iced UI framework for desktop
2. **Web Interface**: Rust application targeting WebAssembly with Leptos for browsers
3. **Mobile Interface**: Native apps for Android and iOS

All interfaces follow a common interaction model:
- Chat-centric interface for primary interaction
- Information windows for detailed content display
- Context menus for contextual operations
- NATS-based backend communication

### Security

The security architecture is built around:
- Air-gapped Root CA generation
- YubiKey integration for hardware-based security
- Multi-level key hierarchy
- Mutual TLS for service-to-service communication
- Role-based access control
- Event signing and verification

## Next Steps

With the Initial System Design phase completed, we will now move into implementation:

1. **Implement common domain objects** that can be shared across all CIM instances
2. Configure NATS JetStream for event sourcing and object storage
3. Create the NixOS module framework for composable deployment
4. Build the domain graph storage and visualization tools
5. Implement service interfaces and MCP integration
6. Begin work on IPLD object store
7. Start development of user interfaces
8. **Implement specific domain models** for vertical markets
9. **Integrate vertical-specific domains with the common domain model**

The architecture we've designed allows for creating specialized CIM instances for different domains while sharing the common infrastructure, services, and domain objects. This approach enables tailoring the system to specific vertical markets while maintaining a consistent technical foundation.
