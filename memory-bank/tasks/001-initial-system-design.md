## Progress Notes

### 2023-04-04: Initial System Design
Completed the high-level system architecture design. Identified seven core components:
1. Information Unit System
2. Component Registry
3. Pipeline Engine
4. Plugin System
5. Storage Manager
6. User Interface Framework
7. Integration Hub

Defined the component interaction model using message passing, interface contracts, and dependency injection. Established data flow mechanisms including pipeline processing, transformation chains, and event streaming. Identified key extension points for components, interfaces, integration, and types.

Documentation created in memory-bank/system_design.md.

## Time Estimate
The high-level design is complete. Detailed specifications will require additional time to develop.

## Dependencies
None - This is the initial design task.

## Notes
This is a Level 0 (Initial Design) task that focuses on establishing the foundational architecture and components of the CIM system. The high-level design is now complete, but detailed component specifications and interface definitions need further development.
