### 2023-04-05: Base CIM Services Definition
Established the core services that constitute a base CIM installation:

1. **AI**: AI Chat Interface with access to MCP servers and multiple tuned models
2. **NATS**: Messaging backbone for inter-service communication, event store, and object store
3. **Git**: Version control for configurations, source code, and issue tracking
4. **Mail**: Email system for communication, workflow integration, and notifications
5. **Search**: Centralized search via SearXNG with API-based access
6. **Docs**: Document management (such as PaperlessNG) for storage, tagging, and retrieval
7. **Web**: Web portal for unified system access and consistent user experience
8. **WF**: Workflow automation via n8n for process orchestration
9. **Vault**: Secret management via Vaultwarden for secure credential storage
10. **Notes**: Knowledge management (such as Obsidian or Trilium Next) for notes and knowledge graphs
11. **Feeds**: RSS feed integration for content processing and routing
12. **DB**: Database services with Neo4j for graph data and PostgreSQL for relational data

These services collectively form a complete information management ecosystem, with each service implemented as a containerized component following our dual-interface approach (NATS and MCP). For third-party tools, we'll leverage official MCP interfaces where available and develop custom NATS integrations around their APIs.

Documentation added as a design decision in docs/notes/008-base-cim-services.md.

### 2023-04-06: Cross-Domain Interaction Patterns
Established comprehensive patterns for interactions between domains:

1. **Event-Based Integration**: Primary pattern using domain events published to NATS JetStream
2. **Shared Reference Data**: Common domains serve as canonical sources with reference by ID
3. **Domain Service Interfaces**: Explicit service interfaces via NATS subjects using command/query pattern
4. **Saga Pattern**: For processes spanning multiple domains with compensating actions
5. **Domain Relationship Registry**: Neo4j-based registry of relationships between entities across domains

These patterns are implemented using our NATS JetStream architecture with standardized event structures and subject naming conventions. The implementation approach includes domain-specific NATS subjects following the convention `domain.entity.event/command/query` and process coordination via the n8n workflow service.

We've documented concrete examples showing these patterns in action, including patient registration in the healthcare vertical and document upload workflows. Each example demonstrates how domains communicate while maintaining their boundaries.

Documentation added as a design decision in docs/notes/009-cross-domain-interaction-patterns.md.

### 2023-04-06: Domain Event Flow Patterns
Established comprehensive patterns for domain event flows throughout the system:

1. **Standardized Event Structure**: Defined a consistent JSON structure for all domain events, including:
   - Core fields: id, type, source, time, version
   - Context fields: correlationId, causationId
   - Payload data structure
   - Metadata for auxiliary information

2. **NATS Subject Hierarchy**: Created a convention for event publication using the pattern:
   ```
   events.{domain}.{entity}.{eventType}[.v{version}]
   ```

3. **Event Flow Patterns**:
   - Command → Event → Projection Pattern
   - Saga Coordination Pattern
   - Event Enrichment Pattern
   - Event Archival Pattern

4. **JetStream Configuration**: Defined stream configuration with domain-specific streams, retention policies, replication, and compression settings.

5. **Event Evolution Strategy**: Established an approach for versioning and evolving event schemas while maintaining compatibility.

These patterns ensure consistent event structure and flow across all domains, enabling reliable system-wide communication while respecting domain boundaries. They align perfectly with our NATS JetStream architecture and support our cross-domain interaction patterns.

Documentation added as a design decision in docs/notes/010-domain-event-flow-patterns.md.

### 2023-04-06: IPLD Content-Addressable Storage
Established IPLD (InterPlanetary Linked Data) as the foundational data model for our Object Store:

1. **Content-Addressed Storage**: All objects are identified by Content IDs (CIDs) derived from their cryptographic hash, ensuring data integrity and verification.

2. **Event-Object Linkage**: Every Object Store operation has a corresponding Event Store entry that references the object's CID, creating a complete audit trail.

3. **Immutability Enforcement**: Objects are treated as immutable - once stored with a CID, the content cannot change. Updates are implemented as new objects with new CIDs, with version relationships tracked through events.

4. **Merkle-DAG Structure**: Objects can reference other objects via their CIDs, creating a directed acyclic graph that enables complex data structures as compositions of smaller objects.

5. **Multi-tier Implementation**: Objects and their CIDs remain consistent as they flow through our multi-tier storage architecture (NATS JetStream → 3-Node Cluster → Wasabi).

This approach provides strong guarantees for data integrity, enables natural deduplication, creates a comprehensive audit trail, and aligns with modern distributed systems principles. The content-addressed nature of IPLD also simplifies many aspects of distributed storage, as objects can be referenced consistently regardless of their physical location.

Documentation added as a design decision in docs/notes/011-ipld-content-addressable-storage.md.

## Time Estimate
The high-level design, domain pattern definition, implementation architecture decisions, distributed event/object store strategy, base CIM services definition, cross-domain interaction patterns, domain event flow patterns, and content-addressable storage approach are complete. We're now focused on detailed component specifications and interface definitions.

## Dependencies
None - This is the initial design task.

## Notes
This is a Level 0 (Initial Design) task that focuses on establishing the foundational architecture and components of the CIM system. Most of the high-level architectural decisions are now complete, but detailed component specifications and interface definitions still need development.
