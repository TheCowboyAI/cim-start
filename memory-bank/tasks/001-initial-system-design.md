### 2023-04-05: Base CIM Services Definition
Established the core services that constitute a base CIM installation:

1. **AI**: AI Chat Interface with access to MCP servers and multiple tuned models
2. **NATS**: Messaging backbone for inter-service communication, event store, and object store
3. **Git**: Version control for configurations, source code, and issue tracking
4. **Mail**: Email system for communication, workflow integration, and notifications
5. **Search**: Centralized search via SearXNG with API-based access
6. **Docs**: Document management (such as PaperlessNG) for storage, tagging, and retrieval
7. **Web**: Web portal for unified system access and consistent user experience
8. **WF**: Workflow automation via n8n for process orchestration
9. **Vault**: Secret management via Vaultwarden for secure credential storage
10. **Notes**: Knowledge management (such as Obsidian or Trilium Next) for notes and knowledge graphs
11. **Feeds**: RSS feed integration for content processing and routing
12. **DB**: Database services with Neo4j for graph data and PostgreSQL for relational data

These services collectively form a complete information management ecosystem, with each service implemented as a containerized component following our dual-interface approach (NATS and MCP). For third-party tools, we'll leverage official MCP interfaces where available and develop custom NATS integrations around their APIs.

Documentation added as a design decision in docs/notes/008-base-cim-services.md.

## Time Estimate
The high-level design, domain pattern definition, implementation architecture decisions, distributed event/object store strategy, and base CIM services definition are complete. Detailed specifications will require additional time to develop.

## Dependencies
None - This is the initial design task.

## Notes
This is a Level 0 (Initial Design) task that focuses on establishing the foundational architecture and components of the CIM system. The high-level design, domain pattern definition, implementation architecture decisions, distributed strategy, and base CIM services are now defined, but detailed component specifications, interface definitions, NixOS module design, and event schema design need further development.
