## Progress Notes

### 2023-04-04: Initial System Design
Completed the high-level system architecture design. Identified seven core components:
1. Information Unit System
2. Component Registry
3. Pipeline Engine
4. Plugin System
5. Storage Manager
6. User Interface Framework
7. Integration Hub

Defined the component interaction model using message passing, interface contracts, and dependency injection. Established data flow mechanisms including pipeline processing, transformation chains, and event streaming. Identified key extension points for components, interfaces, integration, and types.

Documentation created in memory-bank/system_design.md.

### 2023-04-04: Domain Pattern Definition
Defined nine domain pattern categories that provide guidance on information organization, processing, and presentation:
1. Information Classification Patterns
2. Knowledge Representation Patterns
3. Information Retrieval Patterns
4. Content Processing Patterns
5. Information Synthesis Patterns
6. Collaborative Information Patterns
7. Information Lifecycle Patterns
8. Context Management Patterns
9. Adaptation Patterns

Each category includes multiple specific patterns with implementation details. These domain patterns will inform how the technical components are implemented and interact.

Documentation created in memory-bank/domainPatterns.md and referenced in system_design.md.

### 2023-04-04: Implementation Architecture Decision
Determined that the CIM will be implemented as a hyper-converged solution using NixOS:
- Core system will be built as a NixOS configuration for the host
- Functionality will be added through modular NixOS modules
- Individual components will be deployed as isolated nixos-containers
- Host will be minimal, focusing on security, container hosting, and NATS messaging
- System will be part of a broader inventory management

This approach aligns well with our modular component architecture, providing clear deployment boundaries while enabling efficient communication between components.

Documentation updated in memory-bank/techContext.md.

### 2023-04-04: Event/Object Store and Distributed Architecture
Decided to use NATS JetStream as both an Event Store and Object Store, providing:
- Persistent event sourcing for reliable state management
- Event streaming for component communication
- Object storage for binary data and shared resources
- Integration with remote cloud resources

While the system is primarily hyper-converged on a central server, it will also communicate with remote cloud resources through NATS, creating a distributed architecture that extends beyond the local system.

Documentation updated in memory-bank/techContext.md.

### 2023-04-05: Multi-Tier Storage Strategy
Implemented a robust multi-tier storage strategy that extends beyond the hyper-converged system:
1. **Primary Tier (NATS JetStream)** - Real-time storage within the hyper-converged system
2. **Secondary Tier (Cluster)** - 3-node replica of the leaf node for high availability and compute-intensive tasks
3. **Tertiary Tier (Wasabi)** - Long-term archival storage for durability and disaster recovery

This approach provides multiple benefits:
- Performance optimization for active data in JetStream
- High availability through 3-node cluster
- Long-term durability and disaster recovery with Wasabi
- Cost-effective storage tiering based on access patterns

Documentation updated in memory-bank/techContext.md with a new architecture diagram.

### 2023-04-05: Scaling Architecture Enhancement
Defined a comprehensive scaling architecture model:
1. **"Leaf Node"** - Single hyper-converged node serving as the local system entry point
   - Complete functionality in a self-contained system
   - Optimized for local connections and processing
   - Projects data to cluster tier for high availability

2. **3-Node Cluster** - Replica of the leaf node in clustered configuration
   - Provides high availability for customer-facing services
   - Handles compute-intensive tasks offloaded from leaf nodes
   - Distributes load across multiple nodes
   - Manages data replication to Wasabi for long-term storage

The scaling path (Leaf Node → 3-Node Cluster → Wasabi) allows for flexible deployment models that can adapt to different operational requirements. Leaf nodes focus on local processing while offloading intensive tasks to the cluster, creating an efficient division of responsibilities.

Documentation updated in memory-bank/techContext.md with enhanced architecture diagram and scaling details.

### 2023-04-05: Business Focus and Domain-Driven Design
Established two key architectural principles:

1. **Business Focus on Medium-Sized Businesses in Vertical Markets**
   - Defined target audience as medium-sized businesses needing specialized workflows
   - Established hybrid cloud approach with internal critical data
   - Outlined progressive scaling from single leaf node to cluster
   - Created value proposition focusing on independence and specialized solutions

2. **Domain-Driven Design for Vertical Markets**
   - Established domain-driven approach with clear domain boundaries
   - Balanced vertical market specialization with common functionality
   - Defined composition model for combining domains
   - Identified common business domains applicable across industries
   - Outlined vertical market domains for specialized industry segments

These principles will guide our implementation approach, ensuring the system addresses specific vertical market needs while leveraging common business functionality. The domain-driven approach aligns well with our event sourcing strategy, as each domain can maintain its own event streams.

Documentation added as design decisions in docs/notes/ and reflected in productContext.md.

## Time Estimate
The high-level design, domain pattern definition, implementation architecture decisions, and distributed event/object store strategy are complete. Detailed specifications will require additional time to develop.

## Dependencies
None - This is the initial design task.

## Notes
This is a Level 0 (Initial Design) task that focuses on establishing the foundational architecture and components of the CIM system. The high-level design, domain pattern definition, implementation architecture decisions, and distributed strategy are now complete, but detailed component specifications, interface definitions, NixOS module design, and event schema design need further development.
