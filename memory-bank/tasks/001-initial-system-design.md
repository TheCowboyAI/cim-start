## Progress Notes

### 2023-04-04: Initial System Design
Completed the high-level system architecture design. Identified seven core components:
1. Information Unit System
2. Component Registry
3. Pipeline Engine
4. Plugin System
5. Storage Manager
6. User Interface Framework
7. Integration Hub

Defined the component interaction model using message passing, interface contracts, and dependency injection. Established data flow mechanisms including pipeline processing, transformation chains, and event streaming. Identified key extension points for components, interfaces, integration, and types.

Documentation created in memory-bank/system_design.md.

### 2023-04-04: Domain Pattern Definition
Defined nine domain pattern categories that provide guidance on information organization, processing, and presentation:
1. Information Classification Patterns
2. Knowledge Representation Patterns
3. Information Retrieval Patterns
4. Content Processing Patterns
5. Information Synthesis Patterns
6. Collaborative Information Patterns
7. Information Lifecycle Patterns
8. Context Management Patterns
9. Adaptation Patterns

Each category includes multiple specific patterns with implementation details. These domain patterns will inform how the technical components are implemented and interact.

Documentation created in memory-bank/domainPatterns.md and referenced in system_design.md.

### 2023-04-04: Implementation Architecture Decision
Determined that the CIM will be implemented as a hyper-converged solution using NixOS:
- Core system will be built as a NixOS configuration for the host
- Functionality will be added through modular NixOS modules
- Individual components will be deployed as isolated nixos-containers
- Host will be minimal, focusing on security, container hosting, and NATS messaging
- System will be part of a broader inventory management

This approach aligns well with our modular component architecture, providing clear deployment boundaries while enabling efficient communication between components.

Documentation updated in memory-bank/techContext.md.

### 2023-04-04: Event/Object Store and Distributed Architecture
Decided to use NATS JetStream as both an Event Store and Object Store, providing:
- Persistent event sourcing for reliable state management
- Event streaming for component communication
- Object storage for binary data and shared resources
- Integration with remote cloud resources

While the system is primarily hyper-converged on a central server, it will also communicate with remote cloud resources through NATS, creating a distributed architecture that extends beyond the local system.

Documentation updated in memory-bank/techContext.md.

### 2023-04-05: Multi-Tier Storage Strategy
Implemented a robust multi-tier storage strategy that extends beyond the hyper-converged system:
1. **Primary Tier (NATS JetStream)** - Real-time storage within the hyper-converged system
2. **Secondary Tier (MinIO on NAS)** - JetStream files projected to NAS for decentralized distribution
3. **Tertiary Tier (Wasabi)** - MinIO S3 buckets replicated to Wasabi for long-term storage

This approach provides multiple benefits:
- Performance optimization for active data in JetStream
- Decentralized access through S3-compatible MinIO interface
- Long-term durability and disaster recovery with Wasabi
- Cost-effective storage tiering based on access patterns

Documentation updated in memory-bank/techContext.md with a new architecture diagram.

## Time Estimate
The high-level design, domain pattern definition, implementation architecture decisions, and distributed event/object store strategy are complete. Detailed specifications will require additional time to develop.

## Dependencies
None - This is the initial design task.

## Notes
This is a Level 0 (Initial Design) task that focuses on establishing the foundational architecture and components of the CIM system. The high-level design, domain pattern definition, implementation architecture decisions, and distributed strategy are now complete, but detailed component specifications, interface definitions, NixOS module design, and event schema design need further development.
