# Technology Context

## Technology Stack

The CIM project will be implemented as a hyper-converged solution using NixOS. 

### Implementation Architecture

- **NixOS Base System**: The system will be built as a NixOS configuration for the host.
- **NixOS Modules**: Functionality will be added through modular NixOS modules.
- **nixos-containers**: Core components will be deployed as isolated nixos-containers.
- **Minimal Host**: The host will only run:
  - Security services
  - Container hosting tools
  - NATS server (shared messaging system)
- **Inventory Management**: The host is tracked as part of an inventory system.

This architecture aligns with our modular component design, with each component potentially deployed as an isolated container while sharing communication infrastructure through NATS.

### Component Deployment Strategy

| Component | Deployment Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Information Unit System | nixos-container |
| Component Registry | nixos-container |
| Pipeline Engine | nixos-container |
| Plugin System | NixOS module + container support |
| Storage Manager | nixos-container |
| User Interface Framework | nixos-container |
| Integration Hub | nixos-container |

### Potential Backend Technologies
- NixOS for system configuration and deployment
- NATS for messaging and component communication
- Rust for performance-critical components
- Python for data processing and analysis
- PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data storage
- Redis for caching and real-time features

### Potential Frontend Technologies
- React or Vue.js for user interfaces
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- D3.js for data visualization
- Electron for desktop applications
- Progressive Web App capabilities

### Infrastructure
- NixOS for containerization and configuration
- Container orchestration via NixOS modules
- CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Potential cloud deployment with NixOS configurations
- NATS for internal service communication

## Development Environment

### Required Tools
- Nix package manager
- Git for version control
- NixOS for development environment
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- NATS client tools for testing
- Terminal for command-line operations

### Development Workflow
- NixOS configuration management
- Feature-branch workflow
- Pull requests for code review
- Automated testing
- Continuous integration
- Reproducible builds via Nix

### Local Setup
Development will use NixOS or nix-shell for consistent environments across team members. Detailed setup instructions will be provided in a separate document.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Component-level tests
- Mocked dependencies
- High coverage goals

### Integration Testing
- Component interaction tests
- API contract testing
- End-to-end workflows
- Container integration testing

### Performance Testing
- Load testing
- Scalability testing
- Bottleneck identification
- Container resource usage analysis

## Documentation Approach
