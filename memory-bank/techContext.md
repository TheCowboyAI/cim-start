# Technology Context

## Technology Stack

The CIM project is currently in the design phase. Specific technology choices will be determined as the project progresses. The following sections outline potential technology areas that may be utilized.

### Potential Backend Technologies
- Node.js/TypeScript for server-side components
- Rust for performance-critical components
- Python for data processing and analysis
- PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data storage
- Redis for caching and real-time features
- Message queues for asynchronous processing

### Potential Frontend Technologies
- React or Vue.js for user interfaces
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- D3.js for data visualization
- Electron for desktop applications
- Progressive Web App capabilities

### Potential Infrastructure
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP) for hosting
- Serverless functions for microservices

## Development Environment

### Required Tools
- Git for version control
- Node.js and npm/yarn for JavaScript development
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Docker for containerized development
- Terminal for command-line operations

### Development Workflow
- Feature-branch workflow
- Pull requests for code review
- Automated testing
- Continuous integration

### Local Setup
Detailed setup instructions will be provided once technology choices are finalized.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Component-level tests
- Mocked dependencies
- High coverage goals

### Integration Testing
- Component interaction tests
- API contract testing
- End-to-end workflows

### Performance Testing
- Load testing
- Scalability testing
- Bottleneck identification

## Documentation Approach

### Code Documentation
- Inline documentation
- API documentation
- Architecture documentation

### User Documentation
- User guides
- API references
- Tutorials and examples

## Versioning and Compatibility

### Semantic Versioning
- Following SemVer (Major.Minor.Patch)
- Breaking changes increment major version
- New features increment minor version
- Bug fixes increment patch version

### Compatibility Commitments
- Backward compatibility within major versions
- Deprecation notices before removal
- Migration guides for major upgrades
