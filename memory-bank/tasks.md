## Notes

- Domain-driven design will guide our implementation approach
- Event sourcing using NATS JetStream will provide a foundation for the domain objects
- Common domains will be implemented first, followed by vertical market examples
- Services will expose dual interfaces: NATS for system components and MCP for AI integration
- Vendor-provided MCP interfaces will be preferred for third-party tools where available
- IPLD will provide content-addressed, immutable storage for objects with event linkage
- User interfaces will follow a chat-centric interaction model with contextual information windows
- Rust will be used across all platforms to maximize code sharing and performance
- Security architecture will use YubiKeys for hardware-based security and authentication
- Root CA will be generated in an air-gapped environment for maximum security
- All communication will be secured with TLS, with mutual TLS for service-to-service communication
