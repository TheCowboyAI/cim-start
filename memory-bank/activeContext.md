# Active Context

## Current Focus

We are currently in the Initial Design phase (Level 0) of the CIM project. The focus is on:

1. Setting up the project structure ✓
2. Defining the system architecture ✓
3. Identifying core components ✓
4. Establishing capabilities and features ✓
5. Defining domain patterns ✓
6. Determining implementation architecture ✓

## Recent Changes

- Created initial project structure
- Set up Memory Bank system
- Defined preliminary project goals and context
- Initialized documentation framework
- Designed high-level system architecture
- Identified core components and their responsibilities
- Established component interaction patterns
- Defined data flow mechanisms
- Created extension point documentation
- Added comprehensive domain pattern documentation
- Integrated domain patterns into system design
- Defined NixOS-based implementation architecture with containers
- Created component deployment strategy

## Action Items

- Refine the core architecture details
- Create detailed component specifications
- Design specific interfaces between components
- Define the API contracts for each component
- Develop detailed data flow diagrams
- Create component implementation roadmap
- Define interactions between system components and domain patterns
- Develop domain-specific use cases applying the patterns
- Design initial NixOS module structure
- Define NATS messaging patterns for inter-component communication
- Create container resource specifications

## Implementation Status

The project is in the conceptualization phase. We have completed the high-level system design and domain pattern definition, and determined the implementation architecture (NixOS with containers), but implementation has not yet begun. The system_design.md file contains the current architectural design, domainPatterns.md defines the domain-specific patterns, and techContext.md details the implementation approach.

## Current Challenges

- Determining the optimal component granularity
- Defining clear interfaces between components
- Establishing a flexible yet consistent composition model
- Balancing simplicity with power/flexibility
- Designing for both ease of use and extensibility
- Ensuring coherent integration between technical architecture and domain patterns
- Maintaining consistency across pattern implementations
- Defining appropriate resource boundaries for containers
- Establishing secure communication patterns between containers
- Designing for efficient state management across containerized components

## Notes

The system architecture is organized around seven core components:
1. Information Unit System
2. Component Registry
3. Pipeline Engine
4. Plugin System
5. Storage Manager
6. User Interface Framework
7. Integration Hub

These components interact through message passing, interface contracts, and dependency injection, with data flowing through pipeline processing, transformation chains, and event streaming.

Additionally, we've defined nine domain pattern categories that provide guidance on information organization, processing, and presentation, which will inform how the technical components are implemented and interact.

The implementation architecture will use NixOS as a hyper-converged solution, with core functionality implemented as NixOS modules and individual components deployed as nixos-containers. The host system will be minimal, focused on security, container management, and providing a shared NATS messaging system for inter-component communication.

This file will be updated continuously as the project progresses. It serves as a snapshot of current activities and focus areas.
