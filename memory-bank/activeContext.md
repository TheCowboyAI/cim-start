# Active Context

## Current Focus

We are currently in the Initial Design phase (Level 0) of the CIM project. The focus is on:

1. Setting up the project structure ✓
2. Defining the system architecture ✓
3. Identifying core components ✓
4. Establishing capabilities and features ✓

## Recent Changes

- Created initial project structure
- Set up Memory Bank system
- Defined preliminary project goals and context
- Initialized documentation framework
- Designed high-level system architecture
- Identified core components and their responsibilities
- Established component interaction patterns
- Defined data flow mechanisms
- Created extension point documentation

## Action Items

- Refine the core architecture details
- Create detailed component specifications
- Design specific interfaces between components
- Define the API contracts for each component
- Develop detailed data flow diagrams
- Create component implementation roadmap

## Implementation Status

The project is in the conceptualization phase. We have completed the high-level system design but implementation has not yet begun. The system_design.md file contains the current architectural design.

## Current Challenges

- Determining the optimal component granularity
- Defining clear interfaces between components
- Establishing a flexible yet consistent composition model
- Balancing simplicity with power/flexibility
- Designing for both ease of use and extensibility

## Notes

The system architecture is organized around seven core components:
1. Information Unit System
2. Component Registry
3. Pipeline Engine
4. Plugin System
5. Storage Manager
6. User Interface Framework
7. Integration Hub

These components interact through message passing, interface contracts, and dependency injection, with data flowing through pipeline processing, transformation chains, and event streaming.

This file will be updated continuously as the project progresses. It serves as a snapshot of current activities and focus areas.
