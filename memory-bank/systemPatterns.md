# System Patterns

## Architectural Patterns

### Modular Component Architecture
The CIM will be built around a modular component architecture where each component:
- Has a clear, single responsibility
- Exposes well-defined interfaces
- Can be developed and tested independently
- Can be composed with other components

### Pipeline Processing Model
Information will flow through pipelines composed of:
- Sources (information inputs)
- Transformers (information processors)
- Sinks (information outputs)

### Event-Driven Communication
Components will communicate primarily through:
- Events/messages
- Standardized payloads
- Decoupled interactions

### Plugin System
Extensibility will be achieved through:
- Well-defined extension points
- Standardized plugin interfaces
- Dynamic loading mechanisms
- Versioned compatibility

## Data Patterns

### Information Units
All data will be structured as:
- Self-contained information units
- With standardized metadata
- Supporting provenance tracking
- Including relationship mappings

### Type System
A flexible type system will:
- Define standard information types
- Support type conversion
- Allow custom type definitions
- Enable type validation

### Persistence Strategy
Information will be persisted using:
- Content-addressable storage
- Immutable data structures
- Incremental updates
- Versioned references

## Workflow Patterns

### Composition Model
Workflows will be composed through:
- Visual pipeline builders
- Configuration-based composition
- Programmatic API interfaces
- Template-based starting points

### Control Flow
Complex workflows will support:
- Conditional branching
- Parallel processing
- Error handling and recovery
- Loop and iteration constructs

## Interface Patterns

### Command Patterns
User interaction will support:
- Direct manipulation
- Command-line interfaces
- Programmatic APIs
- Batch processing

### Visualization Patterns
Information display will utilize:
- Adaptive visualization
- Context-aware views
- Interactive exploration
- Multi-layered information display

## Technical Decisions

This section will be expanded as specific implementation decisions are made regarding:
- Programming languages
- Runtime environments
- Storage technologies
- Communication protocols
- User interface frameworks

## Evolution Strategy

The system will evolve through:
- Incremental enhancement
- Backward compatibility
- Feature toggling
- Migration pathways

## Domain-Driven Design Patterns

The CIM system follows a domain-driven design approach that enables specialization for vertical markets while maintaining a common foundation of functionality.

### Domain Boundary Patterns

1. **Clear Domain Separation**: Each domain is a self-contained unit with well-defined boundaries.
   - Maintains its own events, commands, and queries
   - Has independent data models and business logic
   - Communicates with other domains through explicit interfaces

2. **Common vs. Vertical Domains**: The system differentiates between two types of domains:
   - **Common Business Domains**: Foundational domains applicable across industries (People, Organizations, Documents, etc.)
   - **Vertical Market Domains**: Specialized domains for specific industry segments (Healthcare, Manufacturing, etc.)

3. **Domain Composition Model**: Enables combining domains to create specialized solutions
   - Composition through event streams
   - Domain interoperation via explicit interfaces
   - Configuration-based domain activation and deactivation

### Core Domain Patterns

1. **Event-Centric Domain Model**: Domains are primarily defined by their events
   - Events represent business facts that have occurred
   - Event schema defines the domain language
   - Commands and queries build upon event foundations

2. **Domain State Projection**: Domain state is derived from event streams
   - Read models built from event projections
   - Materialized views optimized for query patterns
   - Domain-specific access patterns for state retrieval

3. **Cross-Domain Communication**:
   - Event-based communication for loose coupling
   - Domain services for direct communication when necessary
   - Integration events for cross-domain coordination

### Domain Implementation Guidelines

1. **Domain Package Structure**: Each domain is organized as a coherent package
   - `domain/[domain-name]/events` - Event definitions
   - `domain/[domain-name]/commands` - Command handlers
   - `domain/[domain-name]/queries` - Query handlers
   - `domain/[domain-name]/projections` - State projections
   - `domain/[domain-name]/services` - Domain services

2. **Domain Event Naming**: Events follow a consistent naming pattern
   - Past-tense verb followed by entity name
   - Specific enough to convey business meaning
   - Example: `PersonCreated`, `DocumentUploaded`, `InventoryAdjusted`

3. **Domain Object Principles**:
   - Strong enforcement of invariants
   - Rich domain models with behavior
   - Immutable where possible, especially for events
   - Clear validation rules at domain boundaries
