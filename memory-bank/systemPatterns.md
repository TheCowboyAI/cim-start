# System Patterns

## Architectural Patterns

### Modular Component Architecture
The CIM will be built around a modular component architecture where each component:
- Has a clear, single responsibility
- Exposes well-defined interfaces
- Can be developed and tested independently
- Can be composed with other components

### Pipeline Processing Model
Information will flow through pipelines composed of:
- Sources (information inputs)
- Transformers (information processors)
- Sinks (information outputs)

### Event-Driven Communication
Components will communicate primarily through:
- Events/messages
- Standardized payloads
- Decoupled interactions

### Plugin System
Extensibility will be achieved through:
- Well-defined extension points
- Standardized plugin interfaces
- Dynamic loading mechanisms
- Versioned compatibility

## Data Patterns

### Information Units
All data will be structured as:
- Self-contained information units
- With standardized metadata
- Supporting provenance tracking
- Including relationship mappings

### Type System
A flexible type system will:
- Define standard information types
- Support type conversion
- Allow custom type definitions
- Enable type validation

### Persistence Strategy
Information will be persisted using:
- Content-addressable storage
- Immutable data structures
- Incremental updates
- Versioned references

## Workflow Patterns

### Composition Model
Workflows will be composed through:
- Visual pipeline builders
- Configuration-based composition
- Programmatic API interfaces
- Template-based starting points

### Control Flow
Complex workflows will support:
- Conditional branching
- Parallel processing
- Error handling and recovery
- Loop and iteration constructs

## Interface Patterns

### Command Patterns
User interaction will support:
- Direct manipulation
- Command-line interfaces
- Programmatic APIs
- Batch processing

### Visualization Patterns
Information display will utilize:
- Adaptive visualization
- Context-aware views
- Interactive exploration
- Multi-layered information display

## Technical Decisions

This section will be expanded as specific implementation decisions are made regarding:
- Programming languages
- Runtime environments
- Storage technologies
- Communication protocols
- User interface frameworks

## Evolution Strategy

The system will evolve through:
- Incremental enhancement
- Backward compatibility
- Feature toggling
- Migration pathways
