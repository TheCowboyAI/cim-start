# System Patterns

This document outlines the architectural patterns, design principles, and implementation approaches used in our project.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Approach

Our system follows Domain-Driven Design principles to create a rich, expressive model that aligns with business requirements.

### Core DDD Concepts

1. **Ubiquitous Language**: A shared language between technical and domain experts, documented in our domain model.
2. **Bounded Contexts**: Explicit boundaries between different parts of the system with their own ubiquitous language.
3. **Entities**: Objects with identity and lifecycle (e.g., User, Order).
4. **Value Objects**: Immutable objects defined by their attributes (e.g., Address, Money).
5. **Aggregates**: Clusters of domain objects treated as a unit, with a designated root entity.
6. **Repositories**: Abstraction layer for persistence of domain objects.
7. **Domain Events**: Events that represent something meaningful to domain experts.
8. **Domain Services**: Operations that don't naturally fit within entities or value objects.

### Domain Model Structure

Our domain model is stored in the `/domain` directory, organized by bounded context:

```
/domain
  ├── /boundedContext1
  │   ├── entities.md
  │   ├── valueObjects.md
  │   ├── repositories.md
  │   ├── services.md
  │   └── events.md
  ├── /boundedContext2
  │   └── ...
  └── domainGraph.md
```

### Domain Graph

The domain graph (maintained in `domainGraph.md`) provides a visual representation of our domain model, including:

1. **Entities and Value Objects**: Core domain concepts
2. **Relationships**: Connections and dependencies between domain objects
3. **Bounded Contexts**: Boundaries and relationships between contexts
4. **Aggregates**: Clustering of related entities and value objects

The domain graph is maintained using Mermaid.js diagrams for compatibility with GitHub and other Markdown viewers. It is updated during the Design Phase of any task that impacts the domain model.

## Design Patterns

In addition to DDD, we apply the following design patterns:

- **SOLID principles**: Single responsibility, Open/closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, Dependency inversion
- **Component-based design**: Systems built from reusable components
- **Capabilities Model**: Components expose specific capabilities
- **Reactive Programming**: Event-driven, resilient, responsive systems
- **Functional Programming**: Immutable data and pure functions where appropriate
- **Strategy Pattern**: Dynamic algorithm selection
- **Observer Pattern**: For event notifications

## Design Phase Process

During the Design Phase, we follow these steps:

1. **Domain Analysis**:
   - Identify key domain concepts
   - Establish the ubiquitous language
   - Define bounded contexts

2. **Domain Modeling**:
   - Create/update entities and value objects
   - Define aggregates and their boundaries
   - Design repositories and services
   - Document domain events

3. **Domain Graph Maintenance**:
   - Update the visual domain graph in `domainGraph.md`
   - Document relationships between domain objects
   - Validate consistency with domain experts
   - Use Mermaid diagrams for visual representation

4. **Architecture Review**:
   - Ensure alignment with DDD principles
   - Validate against SOLID principles
   - Check for proper encapsulation and boundaries
   - Verify separation of concerns

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Domain Layer**: Pure domain logic without infrastructure dependencies
2. **Application Layer**: Orchestration of domain objects to perform tasks
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Technical implementations of repositories, etc.
4. **Interfaces Layer**: UI, API endpoints, etc.

## Technical Approach

- **Event-Driven Architecture** for loose coupling between components
- **Transaction Event Pattern** using Git commits as the primary transaction event
- **Message Bus** for event distribution (will be implemented later)
- **CQRS Pattern** for separating read and write operations where appropriate
