## CIM Architecture

The **Composable Information Machine (CIM)** architecture is purpose-driven, designed to address specific needs in building real-world business systems using **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, **Event Sourcing**, **Reactive Systems**, and **AI Agents**. This architecture is not a general-purpose framework or a guide for using tools like Nix or NixOS generically. Instead, it demonstrates how these tools can be purposefully combined to create deterministic, maintainable, scalable, and intelligent systems tailored for modern business needs.

### Philosophy and Purpose

This architecture is for developers who:
- Care deeply about **Domains**, **Event Sourcing**, **Reactive Systems**, and leveraging **AI Agents**.
- Need to build client-specific systems with a focus on business logic rather than infrastructure.
- Value determinism, encapsulation, scalability, responsiveness, and intelligence in their systems.

It is **not** suitable for:
- Ephemeral or anonymous systems.
- Developers who do not prioritize DDD, Event Sourcing, Reactive principles, or the integration of AI.

While this approach does not aim to solve every problem in DDD, Event Sourcing, Reactive Systems design, or AI integration, it provides a structured, opinionated way to make these methodologies more approachable. The patterns we use are specific but adaptable, evolving over time as needed.

We also **use the system to build the system**.

### Deterministic System Representation
A core requirement of the CIM architecture is the ability to deterministically represent the "entire system." NixOS plays a critical role here by enabling us to define and control all aspects of the system in a reproducible manner. However, rather than relying on a monolithic configuration (e.g., a single large flake), we emphasize modularity and encapsulation.

But how do all these interconnected things actually connect and what do those connections mean?

Spelunking your system at the command line via log files won't work with 5000 "configurations" running 10,000 "components".

### Key Components
To achieve our goals, the CIM architecture relies on four foundational components: **Base Configuration**, **Development Shell**, **Reactive Systems**, and **AI Agents**. These components ensure that developers can work in an isolated, controlled environment while maintaining flexibility for deployment.

#### Base Configuration
The base configuration provides a working system with all necessary source code and dependencies preconfigured. It is designed to run on Wayland and ensures that developers can immediately execute meaningful programs beyond simple "Hello World" examples. The "program" helps "make the program".

This is and isn't an "IDE", the system can work on itself... But you can also just work in your favorite `editor`.

This is a VERY different approach. If you have followed the work of [MakePad](https://github.com/makepad/makepad) we have a similar `evolutionary`, `dog-fooding` approach.

This is a `Rust` base. We intend several other languages later. If you think our rust syntax could be better, please school us.

#### Development Shell
The development shell is where active source code work happens. It integrates seamlessly with tools like `direnv` to automate environment setup. This shell provides all the tools and dependencies needed for development without polluting the host system.

#### Reactive Systems
The CIM architecture incorporates principles from [The Reactive Manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) to ensure that systems are:
- **Responsive**: Deliver consistent performance under varying workloads.
- **Resilient**: Handle failures gracefully through replication, isolation, and delegation.
- **Elastic**: Scale dynamically based on demand.
- **Message-Driven**: Use asynchronous message-passing for communication between components.

By adhering to these principles, CIM enables the creation of systems that are robust, scalable, and capable of handling real-world complexity. Communication between modules in CIM leverages technologies such as **NATS lattice**, ensuring high throughput and low latency while maintaining decoupled interactions.

#### AI Agents
The integration of **AI Agents** adds an intelligent layer to the CIM architecture. These agents are built using **Rust** for performance and safety alongside **Ollama** for natural language processing capabilities. AI Agents are designed to:
- Operate as autonomous services within the system.
- Communicate asynchronously via NATS messaging.
- Build embeddings and conceptual spaces for domain-specific understanding.
- Assist in translating contextual meaning between languages or data representations.
- Work collaboratively with other components to enhance decision-making and automation.

This AI-driven approach allows the system to adapt dynamically to complex scenarios while reducing manual intervention. By leveraging Rust's efficiency and Ollama's advanced NLP capabilities, AI Agents provide both speed and intelligence within the architecture.

### Extending to Production

The CIM architecture scales naturally from development to production. The production environment includes:
- A fully enabled CI/CD pipeline.
- Multiple system configurations and modules.
- Communication between modules via a **NATS lattice**.
- Event persistence through **JetStream**.
- Reactive principles applied across the system for scalability and fault tolerance.
- AI Agents deployed as NATS services that continuously learn from events and improve their outputs over time.

This setup ensures that production systems remain deterministic, scalable, responsive, intelligent, and maintainable while adhering to DDD, Event Sourcing, Reactive principles, and AI-driven innovation.

### Summary

The CIM architecture offers an opinionated yet flexible approach to building real-world business systems using DDD, Event Sourcing, Reactive Systems, and AI Agents. By leveraging NixOS for determinism and reproducibility alongside *The Reactive Manifesto*'s principles for responsiveness and resilience—and integrating advanced AI capabilities through Rust and Ollama—it provides an encapsulated environment for development and deployment. This approach prioritizes business logic while ensuring scalability, fault tolerance, adaptability, and intelligence—making it ideal for client-specific systems where domains, events, reactivity, and AI are central.
