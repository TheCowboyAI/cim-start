## **Diagram Explanation: CIM Architecture**

This diagram represents the  **Composable Information Machine (CIM)** , a hybrid cloud solution designed for distributed, event-driven systems. It illustrates the workflow and architecture for building, deploying, and operating deterministic systems across local and cloud environments.

## **Key Components and Workflow**

## **1. Manual Input and Source Code Management**

* The process begins with an **Owner** initializing a repository (`git init`) and submitting source code (`CommitSubmitted`).
* The source code is maintained in a  **Git Repository** , where changes are reviewed by **Maintainers** via pull requests (`PullRequest`).

## **2. Building Packages**

* Upon approval of a pull request, the system uses **Nix** to deterministically build the package:
  * **Build Instructions** are defined in the repository.
  * The command `nix build` is executed to create the package.
  * A successful build triggers a `BuildSucceeded` event, followed by a `PackagePublished` event.

## **3. Configuring and Deploying Packages**

* Once a package is published:
  * It is configured into a **NixOS Module** (`PackageConfigured`).
  * A new context is created (`ContextCreated`) in the system's configuration.
  * The configuration is added to a target environment (`ConfigurationAdded`).
  * The package is deployed as a container (`ContainerDeployed`) to a  **Leaf Node** , which is a physical or virtual server running NixOS.

## **4. Event-Driven Communication (Local Environment)**

* The local environment includes:
  * An **Event Store** and an **Object Store** for storing events (`CIDEvents`) and objects.
  * A **NATS** server that facilitates event-driven communication between components.
  * Local leaf nodes subscribe to domain events and publish them to the cloud.

## **5. Cloud Environment (CowboyAI)**

* In the cloud environment:
  * Events are sent from local nodes to the **Domain Cluster** via NATS (`JetStream Domain Events`).
  * The domain cluster processes these events and stores them in partitioned storage:
    * An **Event Store** for domain-level events.
    * An **Object Store** (e.g., S3) for scalable object storage.
  * Each domain is defined by its bounded context (`BoundedContextDefined`) following Domain-Driven Design principles.

## **Key Features of CIM Architecture**

1. **Deterministic Builds with Nix** :

* Ensures reproducibility across environments using `nix build`.

1. **Event-Driven Design with NATS** :

* Enables asynchronous communication between local and cloud components.

1. **Hybrid Cloud Deployment** :

* Combines local-first development with scalable cloud infrastructure.

1. **Domain-Centric Approach** :

* Adheres to Domain-Driven Design principles for clear boundaries between contexts.

1. **Scalable Storage** :

* Uses partitioned storage (e.g., S3) for events and objects in the cloud.
