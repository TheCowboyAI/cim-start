## ðŸŽ­ SAGE Orchestration System

**NEW: CIM-Start now includes SAGE - a master orchestrator coordinating 25 specialized expert agents!**

SAGE (Strategic Agent Guidance Engine) provides intelligent orchestration of all CIM development activities through a unified interface. Instead of manually coordinating agents, SAGE analyzes your requirements and automatically engages the right experts in the optimal sequence.

### The 26 Expert Agents

SAGE coordinates these specialized experts:

**Domain & Architecture (6)**: cim-expert, cim-domain-expert, ddd-expert, event-storming-expert, domain-expert, domain-ontologist-researcher
**Development & Testing (3)**: bdd-expert, tdd-expert, qa-expert
**Infrastructure (5)**: nats-expert, network-expert, nix-expert, git-expert, subject-expert
**UI/UX (4)**: iced-ui-expert, elm-architecture-expert, cim-tea-ecs-expert, ricing-expert
**Knowledge & Semantics (3)**: conceptual-spaces-expert, graph-expert, language-expert
**Organization & Context (4)**: people-expert, org-expert, location-expert, resource-expert
**Orchestration (1)**: sage (master coordinator)

## Overview

CIM agents are composable, event-driven modules that enhance domain workflows with intelligent automation. With SAGE orchestration, these agents work together seamlessly as a unified system rather than isolated components.

## Agent Architecture

### Core Principles

1. **SAGE-Orchestrated**: All agents coordinate through SAGE for optimal workflows
2. **Event-Driven**: Agents respond to domain events through NATS messaging
3. **Composable**: Mix and match agents based on domain needs
4. **Autonomous**: Each agent operates independently within defined boundaries
5. **Domain-Aware**: Agents understand and participate in business workflows
6. **Expert-Specialized**: Each of the 25 agents brings deep expertise in their domain

### Agent Types

#### System Agents
Handle infrastructure and operational concerns:
- Performance monitoring
- Resource management
- Health checks
- Automated operations

#### Integration Agents  
Connect domains with external systems:
- API connectors
- Data synchronization
- Protocol translation
- Service orchestration

#### AI Agents
Provide intelligent decision-making:
- Natural language processing
- Pattern recognition
- Fraud detection
- Conversational interfaces

#### User Agents
Automate user-facing processes:
- Workflow execution
- Task management
- Notification delivery
- Interface automation

## Getting Started with SAGE

### The SAGE-First Approach (Recommended)

```bash
# Simply ask SAGE to handle everything
@sage Create a complete agent system for my [domain]
@sage Set up monitoring agents for production
@sage Design an AI-powered customer service workflow
```

SAGE will:
1. Analyze your requirements
2. Engage relevant experts from the 25-agent team
3. Coordinate multi-agent workflows
4. Generate all necessary configurations
5. Validate the complete system

### Manual Agent Configuration (Advanced)

#### 1. Choose Agent Templates

Start with pre-built templates from `/agents/templates/`:

```bash
# Copy a template
cp agents/templates/system-agent.yaml agents/my-monitor.yaml

# Customize for your domain
vim agents/my-monitor.yaml
```

### 2. Configure Agent Triggers

Agents respond to domain events defined in your domain definition:

```yaml
triggers:
  - name: "order-placed"
    type: "event"
    event_pattern: "event.order.placed"
    command: "ProcessOrder"
```

### 3. Define Capabilities

Specify what your agent can do and what permissions it needs:

```yaml
capabilities:
  - name: "order-processing"
    description: "Process customer orders"
    permissions:
      - "read:order-data"
      - "write:order-events"
```

### 4. Set Up NATS Subjects

Configure how your agent communicates through NATS:

```yaml
configuration:
  nats:
    subjects:
      commands: "agent.order.commands"
      events: "agent.order.events"
      status: "agent.order.status"
```

## Integration with Domains

### Domain Event Integration

Agents integrate directly with domain events:

```yaml
# In domain-definition.yaml
agents:
  - id: "fraud-detector"
    type: "ai"
    triggers:
      - event: E004  # OrderPlaced
        command: "AnalyzeFraud"
```

### Agent Workflows

Define multi-agent workflows for complex processes:

```yaml
agent_workflows:
  order_processing:
    trigger: E004  # OrderPlaced
    agent_flow:
      - step: 1
        agent: "ai-fraud-detector"
        condition: "order.placed"
      - step: 2
        agent: "payment-gateway"
        condition: "fraud.approved"
```

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables

Use environment variables for sensitive configuration:

```yaml
configuration:
  external_api:
    base_url: "${EXTERNAL_API_URL}"
    api_key: "${API_KEY}"
```

### Runtime Settings

Configure resource limits and restart policies:

```yaml
configuration:
  runtime:
    memory_limit: "512MB"
    cpu_limit: "0.5"
    restart_policy: "always"
```

## Deployment Options

### Local Development

Run agents locally for development:

```bash
# Start NATS
docker-compose up -d

# Deploy agent
nix run .#deploy-agent -- agents/my-agent.yaml
```

### Production Deployment

Deploy to production infrastructure:

```bash
# Deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f agents/production/

# Deploy to NixOS
nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#production
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Agent Status

Monitor agent health through NATS subjects:

```bash
# Subscribe to agent status
nats sub "agent.*.status"

# Check specific agent
nats req "agent.my-agent.ping" ""
```

### Metrics Collection

Agents can expose metrics for monitoring:

```yaml
configuration:
  monitoring:
    metrics_endpoint: ":9090"
    health_check_endpoint: ":8080/health"
```

## Security Considerations

### Permissions Model

Agents operate with least-privilege permissions:

```yaml
capabilities:
  - name: "read-only-access"
    permissions:
      - "read:customer-data"
      # No write permissions
```

### Authentication

Agents authenticate using JWT tokens or API keys:

```yaml
configuration:
  authentication:
    type: "jwt"
    token: "${AGENT_JWT_TOKEN}"
```

## Examples

### Order Processing Pipeline

See `agents/examples/order-processing-agents.yaml` for a complete order processing pipeline using multiple agent types.

### Customer Service Workflow

See `agents/examples/customer-service-agents.yaml` for an AI-powered customer service implementation.

## Best Practices

### 1. Single Responsibility
Each agent should have a clear, focused purpose.

### 2. Event-First Design
Design agents to respond to events rather than polling for state.

### 3. Graceful Degradation
Ensure domain workflows continue even if agents are unavailable.

### 4. Configuration Management
Use environment variables and external configuration for deployment-specific settings.

### 5. Error Handling
Implement proper error handling and retry logic.

### 6. Monitoring
Include health checks and metrics in all production agents.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent Not Starting**: Check NATS connectivity and configuration
2. **Events Not Triggering**: Verify event patterns match domain events
3. **Permission Errors**: Review capability permissions
4. **Resource Issues**: Check memory and CPU limits

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check agent logs
nats req "agent.my-agent.logs" ""

# Test agent connectivity
nats req "agent.my-agent.ping" ""

# View agent configuration
nats req "agent.my-agent.config" ""
```
