# Development Container
I don't have NixOS...

Fear not, we can just start a container.
You do need somewhere you can run an [OCI Container](https://opencontainers.org/).

This flake can import a container... 
but if you are not already using Nix, 
We don't want to force you to install it.

This container is suitable in any OCI runtime such as Docker, Podman or Portainer.
