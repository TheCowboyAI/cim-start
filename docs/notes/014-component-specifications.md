## Decision ID: 014

**Date**: 2023-04-07  
**Status**: Approved  
**Deciders**: Core Architecture Team  

## Context

The Initial System Design of the CIM system has established the high-level architecture, including seven core components. To complete the design phase and enable implementation to begin, we need detailed specifications for each component. These specifications will define:

- The internal structure of each component
- Specific responsibilities and capabilities
- Resource requirements and dependencies
- Interface definitions and communication patterns
- Implementation considerations

## Decision

We will implement detailed specifications for each of the seven core components as follows:

### 1. Information Unit System

#### Purpose
The Information Unit System provides standardized containers for all data within CIM, ensuring consistency, discoverability, and interoperability across the system.

#### Supported Information Types
- Chat Dialogs
- Text Documents
- Formatted Documents (PDFs)
- Images
- Graphs (Mermaid and Cypher formats)

#### Internal Structure
- **Core Unit**: Immutable content with unique identifier based on IPLD CID
- **Metadata Layer**: Standardized metadata applicable across all domains
- **Relationship Map**: Links to related information units
- **Version Chain**: Sequential immutable diffs forming version history
- **Domain-Specific Extensions**: Domain-dependent attributes and behaviors

#### Immutability and Versioning
- All information units are immutable once created
- Changes are represented as immutable diffs appended to the original
- Versioning is managed through IPLD CIDs for each state
- Version chains track the evolution of information units over time

#### Resource Requirements
- Storage: Optimized for content-addressable storage in NATS JetStream
- Memory: Minimal runtime memory requirements through immutable structures
- Compute: Primarily during creation, validation, and diff generation
- Networking: Low bandwidth needs except during initial unit transfer

#### Interface Definition
- **Creation**: `information.unit.create.<type>`
- **Retrieval**: `information.unit.get.<id>`
- **Query**: `information.unit.query.<parameters>`
- **Version History**: `information.unit.history.<id>`
- **Relationship Traversal**: `information.unit.relationships.<id>`

#### Implementation Considerations
- Immutable data structures require careful design for efficient storage
- Content-addressable retrieval depends on consistent hashing algorithms
- Versioning strategy must support efficient retrieval of both latest and historical versions
- Metadata schema needs to balance standardization with flexibility

- **Cache Manager**: Multi-level caching strategy
- **Tier Manager**: Controls movement between storage tiers
- **Access Control**: NATS-based security model

#### Storage Tiers
- Objects flow through the multi-tier architecture:
  - Local → Leaf Node → Cluster → Super-Cluster
- Tier promotion happens through NATS subjects
- Each tier implements the same interface but with different performance/durability tradeoffs

#### Resource Requirements
- Storage: High (primary function)
- Memory: Moderate for caching frequently accessed content

## Notes

These detailed specifications complete the Initial System Design phase, providing the foundation for implementation planning. As development progresses, these specifications will be refined based on practical experience and evolving requirements.

The component specifications align with our NATS-based messaging architecture, IPLD content-addressable storage approach, and domain-driven design philosophy. They provide a clear path for implementing the core capabilities of the CIM system while maintaining the flexibility and extensibility needed for future evolution.

It's important to note that the original design included seven core components, but based on architectural decisions, we've determined that a separate Plugin System component is not needed. The functionality originally assigned to the Plugin System is effectively handled through our NATS-based communication model, containerization approach, and Component Registry.
