# Design Decision: Domain Objects as Graph Storage with Phased Implementation

## Decision ID: 006

**Date**: 2023-04-05  
**Status**: Approved  
**Deciders**: Core Architecture Team  

## Context

Our domain-driven design approach requires an effective way to store, query, and visualize domain objects and their relationships. Domain objects naturally form a graph with complex relationships between entities across different domains. We need to:

- Store domain objects and their relationships efficiently
- Support graph queries to traverse relationships
- Visualize domain objects and their connections
- Enable cross-domain relationship analysis
- Provide a transition path as our system matures

While Neo4j is our target graph database for production, we need an approach that works during initial development before the full deployment infrastructure is available.

## Decision

We will implement a phased approach to domain object storage and visualization:

1. **Initial Phase: Cypher Graph Files**
   - Store domain object definitions in `/domain` as Cypher graph format
   - This enables easy import into Neo4j when the system is ready
   - Provides a textual representation that can be version-controlled
   - Maintains compatibility with our target graph database

2. **Visualization: Custom Rust/Iced Viewer**
   - Develop a separate module using petgraph (Rust graph library) 
   - Implement custom viewer with Iced UI framework
   - Enable frequent graph visualization during development
   - Support common graph operations and queries

3. **Integration: NATS-Based Interface**
   - Use NATS as the communication channel between CIM components and the graph viewer
   - Prepare standard message formats for graph operations
   - Enable event-driven updates to the graph visualization
   - Maintain loose coupling between core system and visualization tools

## Architecture Implications

- Domain objects will be modeled as graph nodes and relationships
- The `/domain` directory will contain Cypher-formatted graph definitions
- Petgraph will provide graph algorithm capabilities in Rust
- The custom viewer will enable visualization without Neo4j dependency
- NATS will facilitate communication with the graph visualization module
- Migration path to Neo4j will be straightforward due to Cypher format

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Early Visualization**: Graph structure can be viewed before Neo4j deployment
- **Version Control**: Cypher files can be tracked in git like other code
- **Smooth Transition**: Easy import to Neo4j when ready
- **Consistent Interface**: NATS communication pattern aligns with overall architecture
- **Decoupled Development**: Visualization can progress independently of core system
- **Native Performance**: Rust-based tools offer excellent performance
- **Offline Capability**: Doesn't require database during initial development

### Negative

- **Duplicate Effort**: Some work will be repeated when migrating to Neo4j
- **Feature Limitations**: Custom viewer may not have all Neo4j capabilities
- **Synchronization Challenges**: Keeping Cypher files and runtime graph in sync
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs familiarity with Cypher, petgraph, and Iced
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Custom visualization tool requires ongoing support

## Notes

The petgraph library provides a solid foundation for graph operations in Rust, while Iced offers a pure Rust UI toolkit for visualization. This combination enables us to create a high-performance graph visualization tool that will serve our needs during development.

Using Cypher as our storage format ensures compatibility with Neo4j and provides a clear migration path. The NATS-based communication approach aligns with our overall system architecture and enables loose coupling between the core system and visualization tools.

As the system matures, we'll transition to Neo4j while maintaining the same logical graph structure and NATS-based interface, minimizing disruption to dependent components.
