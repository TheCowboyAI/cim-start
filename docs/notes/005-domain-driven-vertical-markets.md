# Design Decision: Domain-Driven Design for Vertical Markets

## Decision ID: 005

**Date**: 2023-04-05  
**Status**: Approved  
**Deciders**: Core Architecture Team  

## Context

CIM customers typically operate in "vertical markets" - specialized industry segments with unique requirements and workflows. These businesses need:

- Industry-specific functionality tailored to their vertical market
- Common business functionality that spans all industries
- Clear boundaries between different domain concerns
- Ability to integrate specialized and common functionality seamlessly
- Flexibility to adapt to specific industry requirements

Traditional systems either provide generic functionality that requires extensive customization or offer highly specialized vertical solutions that lack integration with other business domains.

## Decision

We will implement a domain-driven design approach that:

1. **Uses Domains as Boundaries**:
   - Organizes functionality around business domains
   - Creates clear boundaries between domain concerns
   - Enables specialized vertical market domains to coexist with common domains
   - Facilitates consistent domain modeling across the system

2. **Balances Vertical Specialization and Common Functionality**:
   - Supports specialized vertical market domains (healthcare, manufacturing, legal, etc.)
   - Provides common business domains applicable across industries:
     - People
     - Organizations
     - Locations
     - Documents
     - Inventory
     - Others with common design patterns

3. **Enables Domain Composition**:
   - Allows vertical-specific and common domains to be composed as needed
   - Facilitates interaction between domains through well-defined interfaces
   - Maintains domain integrity while enabling integration

## Architecture Implications

- Component design will align with domain boundaries
- Domain-specific services will encapsulate vertical market functionality
- Common services will provide reusable functionality across domains
- Event sourcing will respect domain boundaries for state management
- Domain relationships will be explicitly modeled and maintained
- Storage strategies will support domain-specific and shared data

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Vertical Market Specialization**: Efficiently addresses industry-specific requirements
- **Reusable Components**: Common domains avoid reinventing standard functionality
- **Clear Boundaries**: Domain isolation improves maintenance and evolution
- **Flexible Composition**: Domains can be assembled to meet specific business needs
- **Reduced Complexity**: Each domain can be reasoned about independently
- **Evolution Support**: Domains can evolve at different rates based on business needs
- **Knowledge Encapsulation**: Domain-specific knowledge is contained within appropriate boundaries

### Negative

- **Domain Boundary Decisions**: Determining optimal domain boundaries requires expertise
- **Integration Complexity**: Cross-domain interactions need careful design
- **Learning Curve**: Understanding multiple domains requires broader knowledge
- **Consistency Challenges**: Maintaining consistency across domains requires coordination
- **Potential Duplication**: Similar functionality might exist in multiple domains with slight variations

## Notes

This domain-driven approach directly supports our focus on medium-sized businesses in vertical markets. By establishing clear domain boundaries, we can address specialized vertical market requirements while leveraging common business domains that all organizations need.

The event sourcing capabilities provided by NATS JetStream align well with domain-driven design, as each domain can maintain its own event streams while still participating in the broader system. This approach enables us to create specialized solutions for vertical markets without sacrificing integration with standard business functions.

Examples of vertical markets we can address include healthcare, legal, manufacturing, education, construction, and financial services - each with their specific domains while sharing common domains like people, organizations, and documents.
