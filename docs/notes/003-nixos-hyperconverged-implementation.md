# Design Decision: NixOS Hyper-Converged Implementation

## Decision ID: 003

**Date**: 2023-04-04  
**Status**: Approved  
**Deciders**: Core Architecture Team  

## Context

The CIM system requires a reliable, reproducible, and efficient deployment approach that:
- Supports a modular component architecture
- Enables clear isolation between components
- Provides consistent configuration management
- Ensures reproducible deployments
- Balances isolation with efficient communication
- Minimizes operational overhead

## Decision

We will implement the CIM as a hyper-converged solution using NixOS:

1. **NixOS Base System**: 
   - The system will be built as a NixOS configuration for the host
   - Consistent, reproducible deployment through declarative configuration

2. **NixOS Modules**: 
   - Functionality will be added through modular NixOS modules
   - Clean separation of concerns and configuration
   - Reusable components across deployments

3. **nixos-containers**: 
   - Core components will be deployed as isolated nixos-containers
   - Resource isolation and security boundaries
   - OS-level virtualization for efficiency

4. **Minimal Host**: 
   - The host will only run:
     - Security services
     - Container hosting tools
     - NATS server (shared messaging system)
   - Reduced attack surface and resource usage

5. **Component Deployment Strategy**:

   | Component | Deployment Approach |
   |-----------|---------------------|
   | Information Unit System | nixos-container |
   | Component Registry | nixos-container |
   | Pipeline Engine | nixos-container |
   | Plugin System | NixOS module + container support |
   | Storage Manager | nixos-container |
   | User Interface Framework | nixos-container |
   | Integration Hub | nixos-container |
   | NATS JetStream | NixOS service (on host) |

## Architecture Implications

- Components are isolated in containers for security and resource control
- NATS provides the communication backbone across containers
- Configuration is managed declaratively through NixOS modules
- Deployment is reproducible and version controlled
- The system scales from a single node to clustered deployments
- Components share the NATS infrastructure while maintaining isolation

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Reproducibility**: NixOS ensures consistent, reproducible deployments
- **Isolation**: Components are isolated for security and resource management
- **Efficiency**: OS-level containers are more efficient than full VMs
- **Maintainability**: Declarative configuration simplifies maintenance
- **Consistency**: Same patterns used across development and production
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports growth from single node to cluster

### Negative

- **Learning Curve**: NixOS and functional configuration have a steep learning curve
- **Ecosystem Constraints**: Some software may not have Nix packages available
- **Resource Sharing**: Containers share kernel, which could be a limitation for some security requirements
- **Configuration Management**: Managing complex NixOS configurations requires expertise
- **Deployment Complexity**: Multi-node deployments add coordination challenges

## Related Decisions

- NATS JetStream selected as Event Store and Object Store
- Multi-tier scaling architecture (Leaf Node → 3-Node Cluster → Wasabi)

## Notes

The NixOS hyper-converged approach aligns well with our modular component design. It provides clear deployment boundaries while enabling efficient communication through NATS. This approach balances isolation, performance, and maintainability.

In our Leaf Node → Cluster model, this architecture is applied to both the leaf nodes and the clustered environment, providing consistent patterns throughout the scaling path.
