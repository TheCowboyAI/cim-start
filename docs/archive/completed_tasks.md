### Task 001: Initial System Design

**Completed**: 2023-04-07
**Related Tasks**: None (first task)

#### Description
This task involved defining the high-level architecture for "A CIM" (Composable Information Machine) as a generic architectural pattern that can be instantiated for different domains. We established core components, interaction patterns, data flow mechanisms, domain patterns, implementation approach, and security architecture. This creates a foundation for building domain-specific CIM instances rather than a single specific system.

#### Key Accomplishments
- Established modular component architecture with seven core components
- Defined domain-driven design approach for vertical markets
- Created multi-tier scaling architecture (Leaf Node → 3-Node Cluster → Wasabi)
- Designed NixOS-based hyper-converged implementation with containerized components
- Established NATS JetStream as both Event Store and Object Store
- Defined IPLD content-addressable storage model
- Designed three primary user interfaces with a common interaction model
- Created security architecture with YubiKey integration
- Defined comprehensive component specifications with resource requirements
- Established standardized interface definitions for all components

#### Implementation Details
The initial system design created a robust architectural pattern for building CIM instances, including:

1. **Architecture Pattern**: A modular component architecture with seven core components, connected through NATS-based messaging. Components include:
   - Information Unit System
   - Component Registry
   - Pipeline Engine
   - Storage Manager
   - User Interface Framework
   - Integration Hub
   - Plugin System functionality (distributed across existing components)

2. **Domain-Driven Approach**: Created clear domain boundaries separating common business domains from vertical market-specific domains. This enables addressing specialized vertical market requirements while leveraging common business functionality.

3. **Implementation Architecture**: A NixOS-based hyper-converged solution with containerized components, enabling reproducible deployments and clear isolation between components.

4. **Storage Strategy**: A multi-tier architecture with IPLD content-addressable storage for data integrity and immutability. NATS JetStream serves as both Event Store and Object Store, providing a robust foundation for event sourcing and object persistence.

5. **User Interface Strategy**: Three primary user interfaces (Native, Web, Mobile) with a common chat-centric interaction model, supported by NATS-based backend communication.

6. **Interface Definitions**: Standardized interfaces for all core components, including event, service, and command interfaces using consistent NATS subject patterns.

7. **Security Architecture**: A secure authentication framework built around a Root CA, YubiKey integration, and multi-level key hierarchy.

All design decisions were documented in 15 detailed design decision documents in the `docs/notes/` directory, providing a comprehensive reference for subsequent implementation. These decisions form a pattern that can be applied to create specific CIM instances for different domains.

#### Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge**: Defining a generic architecture pattern that can be adapted to various domains.
  **Solution**: Created a domain-driven design approach with clear separation between common and vertical-specific domains.
  
- **Challenge**: Balancing component granularity for optimal separation of concerns.
  **Solution**: Identified seven core components with clear, single responsibilities and well-defined interfaces.
  
- **Challenge**: Defining a consistent approach to cross-domain communication.
  **Solution**: Established event-based integration as the primary pattern, with explicit service interfaces for direct operations.

- **Challenge**: Creating a unified storage strategy that supports both events and objects.
  **Solution**: Leveraged NATS JetStream's dual capabilities as both Event Store and Object Store, enhanced with IPLD for content-addressable storage.

- **Challenge**: Designing user interfaces that work consistently across different platforms.
  **Solution**: Defined a common interaction model centered around chat-based interaction, with platform-specific implementations for native, web, and mobile environments.

- **Challenge**: Balancing isolation with efficient communication between containerized components.
  **Solution**: Created a NixOS-based hyper-converged solution that uses containerization for isolation with a shared NATS messaging system for efficient communication.

- **Challenge**: Creating standardized interface definitions that support diverse component needs.
  **Solution**: Established three interface types (event, service, command) with consistent subject naming conventions and message schemas.

#### Lessons Learned

- A modular component architecture with clear boundaries enables independent development and evolution
- Domain-driven design provides a powerful approach to addressing vertical market needs through a common pattern
- NixOS containers offer a good balance of isolation and resource efficiency
- A shared messaging system (NATS) simplifies inter-component communication while maintaining loose coupling
- Event sourcing provides robust audit trails and system recovery capabilities
- Content-addressed storage with IPLD provides built-in data verification and immutability
- Standardized interface definitions are essential for component interoperability
- Multiple user interfaces can provide consistent experiences through shared interaction models
- Hardware-based security provides strong protection for critical system components
- Designing a generic architectural pattern allows for specialized implementations while maintaining consistency
