### Task 001: Initial System Design

**Completed**: 2023-04-07
**Related Tasks**: None (first task)

#### Description
This task involved defining the high-level architecture of the CIM system, including core components, interaction patterns, data flow mechanisms, domain patterns, implementation approach, and security architecture. It established the foundational design decisions that will guide all subsequent development.

#### Key Accomplishments
- Established modular component architecture with seven core components
- Defined domain-driven design approach for vertical markets
- Created multi-tier scaling architecture (Leaf Node → 3-Node Cluster → Wasabi)
- Designed NixOS-based hyper-converged implementation with containerized components
- Established NATS JetStream as both Event Store and Object Store
- Defined IPLD content-addressable storage model
- Designed three primary user interfaces with a common interaction model
- Created security architecture with YubiKey integration
- Defined comprehensive component specifications with resource requirements
- Established standardized interface definitions for all components

#### Implementation Details
The initial system design created a robust architectural foundation for the CIM system, including:

1. **System Architecture**: A modular component architecture with seven core components, connected through NATS-based messaging. Components include:
   - Information Unit System
   - Component Registry
   - Pipeline Engine
   - Storage Manager
   - User Interface Framework
   - Integration Hub
   - Plugin System functionality (distributed across existing components)

2. **Domain-Driven Approach**: Created clear domain boundaries separating common business domains from vertical market-specific domains. This enables addressing specialized vertical market requirements while leveraging common business functionality.

3. **Implementation Architecture**: A NixOS-based hyper-converged solution with containerized components, enabling reproducible deployments and clear isolation between components.

4. **Storage Strategy**: A multi-tier architecture with IPLD content-addressable storage for data integrity and immutability. NATS JetStream serves as both Event Store and Object Store, providing a robust foundation for event sourcing and object persistence.

5. **User Interface Strategy**: Three primary user interfaces (Native, Web, Mobile) with a common chat-centric interaction model, supported by NATS-based backend communication.

6. **Interface Definitions**: Standardized interfaces for all core components, including event, service, and command interfaces using consistent NATS subject patterns.

7. **Security Architecture**: A secure authentication framework built around a Root CA, YubiKey integration, and multi-level key hierarchy.

All design decisions were documented in 15 detailed design decision documents in the `docs/notes/` directory, providing a comprehensive reference for subsequent implementation.

#### Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge**: Balancing component granularity for optimal separation of concerns.
  **Solution**: Identified seven core components with clear, single responsibilities and well-defined interfaces.
  
- **Challenge**: Defining a consistent approach to cross-domain communication.
  **Solution**: Established event-based integration as the primary pattern, with explicit service interfaces for direct operations.

- **Challenge**: Creating a unified storage strategy that supports both events and objects.
  **Solution**: Leveraged NATS JetStream's dual capabilities as both Event Store and Object Store, enhanced with IPLD for content-addressable storage.

- **Challenge**: Designing user interfaces that work consistently across different platforms.
  **Solution**: Defined a common interaction model centered around chat-based interaction, with platform-specific implementations for native, web, and mobile environments.

- **Challenge**: Balancing isolation with efficient communication between containerized components.
  **Solution**: Created a NixOS-based hyper-converged solution that uses containerization for isolation with a shared NATS messaging system for efficient communication.

- **Challenge**: Creating standardized interface definitions that support diverse component needs.
  **Solution**: Established three interface types (event, service, command) with consistent subject naming conventions and message schemas.

#### Lessons Learned

- A modular component architecture with clear boundaries enables independent development and evolution
- Domain-driven design provides a powerful approach to addressing vertical market needs
- NixOS containers offer a good balance of isolation and resource efficiency
- A shared messaging system (NATS) simplifies inter-component communication while maintaining loose coupling
- Event sourcing provides robust audit trails and system recovery capabilities
- Content-addressed storage with IPLD provides built-in data verification and immutability
- Standardized interface definitions are essential for component interoperability
- Multiple user interfaces can provide consistent experiences through shared interaction models
- Hardware-based security provides strong protection for critical system components
