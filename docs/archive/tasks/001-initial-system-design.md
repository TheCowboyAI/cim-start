## Notes

The initial system design has been completed, establishing the foundational architecture for the CIM system. This design includes:

1. **System Architecture**: A modular component architecture with seven core components (Information Unit System, Component Registry, Pipeline Engine, Storage Manager, User Interface Framework, Integration Hub, and Plugin System), connected through NATS-based messaging.

2. **Domain Patterns**: Nine domain pattern categories defining how information is organized, processed, and presented. We've established clear domain boundaries separating common business domains from vertical market-specific domains.

3. **Implementation Architecture**: A NixOS-based hyper-converged solution with containerized components, enabling reproducible deployments and clear isolation between components.

4. **Interaction Model**: Three primary user interfaces (Native, Web, Mobile) with a common chat-centric interaction model, supported by NATS-based backend communication.

5. **Storage Strategy**: A multi-tier architecture (Leaf Node → 3-Node Cluster → Wasabi) with IPLD content-addressable storage for data integrity and immutability.

6. **Component Specifications**: Detailed specifications for all seven core components, including their internal structure, interfaces, resource requirements, and implementation considerations.

7. **Interface Definitions**: Comprehensive interface definitions for all core components, standardizing how they communicate through event, service, and command interfaces using consistent NATS subject patterns.

8. **Security Architecture**: A secure authentication framework built around a Root CA, YubiKey integration, and multi-level key hierarchy.

This design provides a solid foundation for the implementation phase, with clear documentation of all architectural decisions and patterns.
