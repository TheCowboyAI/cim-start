# CIM-Start: Agent-Powered CIM Development Template

Copyright 2025 - Cowboy AI, LLC

## 🎯 **This is a TEMPLATE Repository**

**CIM-Start is a GitHub template for creating CIM projects - it is NOT a CIM itself.**

When you use this template:
1. **Use as GitHub Template** → Creates your new CIM project repository  
2. **Your new repo** becomes the actual CIM you're building
3. **This template** provides the agent system to guide your CIM development

## 🤖 Meet SAGE - Your CIM Creation Guide Template

CIM-Start provides an intelligent agent system template orchestrated by **SAGE** - the template for guiding CIM creation. SAGE coordinates 25 specialized expert agent templates to help users build their actual CIMs.

**🎯 After initialization, users work with active SAGE:**
```bash
# SAGE is now active and domain-aware for the specific project:
@sage I want to build a CIM for my MyCIM domain
@sage Help my team understand our order processing domain  
@sage Set up complete CIM infrastructure for this project
```

**Active SAGE automatically:**
- **Knows the domain**: Based on git repository name and user initialization
- **Routes** requests to appropriate specialist agents for this specific CIM
- **Coordinates** workflows for actual CIM development
- **Synthesizes** guidance from all experts into unified direction  
- **Manages** the complete development journey for this domain

## 🚀 Template Purpose

CIM-Start provides a **template** for intelligent, agent-driven CIM development:

- **Expert-Guided Development Templates** - SAGE coordinates 25 specialized agent templates for CIM creation guidance
- **Collaborative Domain Discovery Templates** - Event Storming session templates with multiple domain expert guidance
- **Infrastructure Automation Templates** - NATS, network topology, and system configuration templates
- **Mathematical Foundation Templates** - Category Theory, Graph Theory, Conceptual Spaces, and IPLD integration patterns
- **Event-Driven Architecture Templates** - Complete event sourcing templates with real-time projection patterns
- **Knowledge Representation Templates** - Ontologies, semantic spaces, and graph-based knowledge structures

## 🎯 How to Create Your CIM Project

**Step 1: Clone CIM-Start as Your Project**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheCowboyAI/cim-start.git MyCIM
cd MyCIM
```

**Step 2: Initialize SAGE for Your Domain**
```bash
claude init
# SAGE detects repo name "MyCIM" and initializes domain
# SAGE removes template status and becomes active for your CIM
```

**Step 3: Ask SAGE to Guide Your CIM Development**
SAGE is now active and domain-aware:

**Key Benefits of DEV Channel Architecture:**
- **Pure JetStream Interface**: Simple, lightweight development environment
- **Complete Development Capture**: Every build step recorded as events
- **Seamless Replication**: DEV channel events flow directly to production
- **No Development Overhead**: Just publish events, JetStream handles the rest
- **Event-Driven Construction**: Use cim-graph to build CIM through events
- **Live Production Ready**: Development events become production system memory

claude --help
# You should see @cim-expert and @domain-expert listed
```

### Step 3: Start Your Domain Creation

**Choose your path:**

**Option A - Complete Guided Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Launch NATS JetStream
make dev

# 2. Build network topology with cim-network MCP
claude "@network-expert Set up network topology for this domain"

# 3. Create your domain
claude "@domain-expert Help me create a customer service domain"
```

**Option B - Get Architecture Guidance:**

/sage I want to build a CIM for my e-commerce business
/sage Help my team understand our order processing domain  
/sage Set up complete CIM infrastructure for logistics
/sage Convert my existing microservices to CIM architecture
```

**🔧 Advanced: Direct Expert Access (when you know exactly what you need)**
```bash
# Domain discovery and analysis
/eventstorming order processing and fulfillment
/ddd analyze these event storming results

# Infrastructure configuration
/nats configure streams and security for my domain
/network set up topology with cim-network MCP  
/nix generate system configuration from events

# Final domain creation
/domain create complete cim-graph structure
```

**⚙️ Manual Setup (legacy approach, not recommended)**
- Manual infrastructure setup with make dev
- Manual agent coordination
- Manual workflow management

## 🐳 NATS JetStream Setup

### Docker Compose (Quickest)
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml provided
# Includes:
# - NATS server with JetStream
# - Monitoring dashboard
# - Persistent storage
```

```bash
# Build and run VM with NATS
nix build .#nats-vm
./result/bin/run-nats-vm
```

### Local Development

3. **Cross-Domain**: Integration with other domains
4. **Production**: Clustering, monitoring, deployment

## 📖 Example Domain

See `/domains/example-business/` for a complete e-commerce domain with:
- Customer registration
- Product catalog
- Order management
- Inventory tracking
- Fulfillment workflow

## 🚦 Quick Start Process

1. **Clone CIM-Start as your project:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheCowboyAI/cim-start.git MyCIM
   cd MyCIM
   ```

2. **Initialize SAGE for your domain:**
   ```bash
   claude init
   # SAGE detects "MyCIM" repo name and initializes as your domain
   # Template status removed - SAGE becomes active for your CIM
   ```

3. **Start building with SAGE:**
   ```bash
   # SAGE is now domain-aware and ready to orchestrate your CIM development
   @sage I want to build a CIM for my restaurant ordering system
   @sage Help me convert my existing API to event-driven CIM architecture  
   @sage My team needs to discover our complex business domain
   ```

4. **SAGE orchestrates everything:**
   - Domain discovery and boundary analysis
   - Infrastructure setup and configuration  
   - Development workflow and quality assurance
   - Complete CIM development journey
