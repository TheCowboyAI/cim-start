# CIM - Composable Information Machine

## Overview

The Composable Information Machine (CIM) is a system designed to help users organize, process, and leverage information in a composable and modular way. It enables the creation of custom information workflows through a flexible, component-based architecture.

## Purpose

CIM addresses the challenges of information overload, isolated information silos, and rigid workflows by providing a flexible framework for information management. It allows users to design their own information processing pipelines using modular components.

## Key Features

- Modular component architecture
- Composable information workflows
- Extensible plugin system
- Flexible data processing
- Standardized information units
- Cross-system integration

## Getting Started

Simply type `SAGE` to start the conversation in Composer using agent mode.

## Project Status

This project is currently in the initial design phase. We are focused on defining the system architecture, core components, and interaction patterns.

## Documentation

Project documentation is stored in the `memory-bank` directory, which serves as the knowledge base for the system. Key files include:

- `projectbrief.md` - Project requirements and goals
- `productContext.md` - Why this project exists and what problems it solves
- `systemPatterns.md` - System architecture and technical decisions
- `techContext.md` - Technology stack and development information
- `progress.md` - Current status and implementation details
- `tasks.md` - Active and planned tasks

## Contributing
