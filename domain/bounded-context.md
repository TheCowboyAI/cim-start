A **Bounded Context** in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a logical boundary within which a specific domain model is defined, consistent, and valid. It serves as the context in which a **Ubiquitous Language**—a shared vocabulary between developers and domain experts—is applied consistently. Within this boundary, the terms, rules, and operations of the model are internally coherent and free from ambiguity.

### Key Characteristics:
1. **Consistency**: The domain model within a bounded context is unified and internally consistent, ensuring there are no contradictions in how concepts are defined or used[1][2].
2. **Ubiquitous Language**: Each bounded context uses its own Ubiquitous Language tailored to its specific domain, which helps bridge communication between technical and business stakeholders[1][5].
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Different parts of a system may use different models for the same concept (e.g., "Customer" or "Product"), depending on the needs of each context. These models are isolated within their respective bounded contexts[1][3].
4. **Mapping Between Contexts**: When multiple bounded contexts interact, mechanisms like context maps or translation layers are used to reconcile differences between their models[1][2].
5. **Alignment to Subdomains**: While subdomains represent areas of responsibility within the problem space, bounded contexts exist in the solution space and often align with subdomains to manage complexity[2][5].

### Example:
In an e-commerce system:
- The **Order Management Context** may define "Customer" as an entity with attributes like order history and payment preferences.
- The **Customer Support Context** might define "Customer" differently, focusing on support tickets and interaction history.
Each context maintains its own model of "Customer," ensuring clarity and reducing complexity.

### Purpose:
Bounded contexts help manage complexity in large systems by dividing them into smaller, manageable parts with clear boundaries. This approach prevents confusion caused by overlapping or ambiguous definitions and ensures that each part of the system can evolve independently[1][5].

# A Bounded Context in Nix is just a package.

We can access it as a derivation, which is a function of attribute-set.

We also refer to a [Bounded Context]())() as a `Category`. A [[category]()](./category.md) is a defined collection of domains working together in a specific way.

In Nix, a **derivation** is a fundamental concept that represents a build recipe or blueprint for constructing a package. It specifies how to build software or other outputs in a reproducible manner. Here's an explanation of its key aspects:

### What is a Derivation?

- **Definition**: A derivation is essentially a set of attributes (key-value pairs) that describe the steps and environment required to build something. It is created using the `derivation` function in the Nix language[1][2][4].
- **Purpose**: It acts as an intermediate representation used by Nix to manage builds. When "realized," it produces an output stored in the Nix store, such as a package or file[1][4].

### Key Attributes

A derivation must include the following attributes:

1. **`name`**: The name of the derivation, which helps identify it in the Nix store.
2. **`system`**: Specifies the target system architecture and operating system (e.g., `x86_64-linux`).
3. **`builder`**: A path to the program or script that will execute the build process[1][2][5].

Additional attributes can be included and are passed as environment variables to the builder during execution.

### Creation and Realization

1. **Creation**: A derivation is created by passing an attribute set to the `derivation` function. This function generates a `.drv` file in the Nix store, which contains all the metadata for building the package[2][3].
2. **Realization**: When you "realize" or "build" a derivation (e.g., using `nix-build`), Nix executes the specified builder with the provided attributes, producing the desired output in the Nix store[1][4].

### Analogy

Think of a derivation as:

- A **recipe** for cooking a dish.
- A **blueprint** for constructing a house.
- A [sketch](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05316) in Compositionality.
  It describes what needs to be done but does not perform any action until explicitly built[1][4].

### Dependencies and Closures

Derivations can depend on other derivations, forming a dependency graph. The combination of a derivation and all its dependencies (direct and transitive) is called its **closure**[4].

### Example

Here’s an example of creating a simple derivation:

```nix
let
  myDerivation = derivation {
    name = "example";
    builder = "/bin/bash";
    system = builtins.currentSystem;
    args = [ "-c" "echo Hello, World! > $out" ];
  };
in myDerivation
```

This defines a derivation that outputs "Hello, World!" into a file in the Nix store when realized.

Derivations are meant to be `pure` in the sense that the same inputs will create the same output every time.

In summary, a derivation in Nix is a declarative specification of how to build something, enabling reproducibility and isolation across systems[1][2][4].
