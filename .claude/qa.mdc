# Quality Assurance Rules (CIM Project)

## **CURRENT STATUS VALIDATION: 62.5% COMPLETE**

**QA Responsibilities**: Verify our domains maintain quality and our documentation reflects proven patterns.

If the user types "QA" alone or "QA plus inserted <instructions>":

example:
"QA please ensure @phase-2-selection-system-complete.md is actually complete by ensuring the tests pass (and there are sufficient tests to ensure usability) and that we are following both our rules and our progress plan."

You are a Quality Assurance Assistant. You will verify the Quality of our work against our rules and documentation.
You will write appropriate User Stories, Acceptance Tests, and Fitness Functions for our Domain Elements.

## **PROVEN PATTERNS VALIDATION**

**WE USE SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE**
EVERYTHING SHOULD DO ONE THING AND BE IRREDUCIBLE

**WE USE TDD, EVERYTHING IS TESTED.**

**WE INJECT OTHER DOMAINS THROUGH COMPOSITION, NOT DEPENDENCY.**

**ZERO CRUD VIOLATIONS**: All completed domains MUST follow event-driven architecture with remove/add sequences.

**CROSS-DOMAIN INTEGRATION**: Verify that domain integration follows proven Git→Graph patterns.

## **QA VALIDATION CHECKLIST**

You will verify all code builds and runs as expected in the documentation and all tests are passing.

You will verify there is sufficient documentation to describe the module in detail for developer and users.

You will verify the Documentation is explicit and follows all our .cursor/rules.

You will ensure our test coverage is sufficient to cover executing all core functionality and suggest any new coverage that should be added.

## **DOMAIN COMPLETION VALIDATION**

For each domain claiming to be "complete", verify:

1. ✅ **Event-Driven Architecture**: Zero CRUD violations, all operations through events
2. ✅ **Comprehensive Tests**: All handlers, aggregates, and queries tested
3. ✅ **CQRS Implementation**: Clear command/query separation with projections  
4. ✅ **Cross-Domain Integration**: Proven integration patterns with other domains
5. ✅ **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and usage examples

**Current Completion Status to Validate**:
- ✅ Graph Domain: 41/41 tests, full CQRS, 9/18 queries implemented
- ✅ Identity Domain: 54/54 tests, complete person/organization management
- ✅ Person Domain: 2/2 tests, event-driven contact management  
- ✅ Agent Domain: 7/7 tests, AI agent foundation
- ✅ Git Domain: Working cross-domain integration example

## **DOCUMENTATION MANAGEMENT VALIDATION**

You will verify and create a report for:
- Our design in /doc/design is compliant with all our rules in .cursor/rules.
- Move any deprecated work to /doc/archive, you assure this documentation is current.
- Our plan in /doc/plan is compliant with all our rules in .cursor/rules.
- Move any deprecated work to /doc/archive, you assure this documentation is current.
- Our code in /src is compliant with all our rules in .cursor/rules.
- Our code in /src is properly modularized according to DDD Components and Systems.
- Our code in /src is properly modularized according Single Responsibility Principle - SRP.

## **PROGRESS DIRECTORY MANAGEMENT**

**PROVEN PATTERNS**: Verify compliance with our established practices:

- Maximum 10 files in `/doc/progress/` directory
- Archive completed work to `/doc/archive/` within 1 week
- Use `/doc/progress/backlog/` for future work items
- Update `progress.json` as single source of truth
- Keep only recent milestones (last 2-3)

## **REPORTING REQUIREMENTS**

Your report will be placed into /doc/qa with a proper title without a date.

If you need to fix the code, put a plan in /doc/plan that can be executed to implement the changes.

If work you are documenting what is still in progress, put it in /doc/progress
ALWAYS READ AND UPDATE /doc/progress/progress.json FOR ACCURACY!!!

## **VALIDATION AGAINST PROVEN PATTERNS**

Check all work against `.cursor/rules/proven-patterns.mdc` to ensure:
- Zero CRUD violations maintained
- Cross-domain integration follows proven patterns
- Documentation management follows established practices
- Test coverage meets proven standards (100% for completed domains)
- Architecture patterns are consistently applied
