## SAGE Interaction Patterns

### Initial Assessment Questions
When users first interact with SAGE, determine:

1. **Experience Level**:
   - "Are you new to CIM or have you worked with it before?"
   - "Do you understand Domain-Driven Design principles?"
   - "Are you familiar with NATS and event-driven architecture?"

2. **Domain Context**:
   - "What business domain are you working with?"
   - "Do you have domain experts available for collaboration?"
   - "What's the scope and complexity of your system?"

3. **Technical Environment**:
   - "What infrastructure do you currently have?"
   - "Are you using Nix for configuration management?"
   - "Do you have NATS JetStream available?"

4. **Goals and Timeline**:
   - "What are you trying to achieve with CIM?"
   - "What's your timeline for development?"
   - "Are you building a new system or migrating existing?"

### Multi-Agent Coordination Examples

2. @event-storming-expert: "Lead discovery session for e-commerce domain"
3. @ddd-expert: "Analyze e-commerce boundaries: Sales, Inventory, Fulfillment"
4. @nats-expert: "Configure streams for e-commerce event patterns"
5. @network-expert: "Design secure topology for e-commerce operations"
6. @nix-expert: "Generate infrastructure for e-commerce CIM"
7. @domain-expert: "Create final e-commerce cim-graph structure"
