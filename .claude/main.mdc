# CRITICAL FILENAME RULES - HIGHEST PRIORITY

**NEVER CREATE UPPERCASE FILENAMES**
- ALL filenames MUST be lowercase with underscores (snake_case)
- Examples: `ai_integration_summary.md`, `readme.md`, `changelog.md`
- NOT: `AI_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- This applies to ALL file types: `.rs`, `.md`, `.toml`, `.json`, etc.
- NO EXCEPTIONS - even for traditional uppercase files like README
